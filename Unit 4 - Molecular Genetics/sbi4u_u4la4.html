                    <p><strong>The Barcode of Life Project</strong> is an example of how Canadians are leading the world in developing pioneering biotechnology. In this case, the tool of genetic sequencing is being used for <strong>biodiversity
                            conservation</strong>. </p>
                    <p>The Barcode of Life Project uses a simple observation from the revolution in genetic sequencing. Most species have short segments of genetic code (approximately 648 base pairs) that are nearly identical across all individuals of that
                        species, but which are different from other species. If we can determine these sequences for every species, then we can quickly identify each species by reading short sections of their DNA, in the same way that a barcode uniquely
                        identifies a product in a store.</p>

                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_04.04.05.png" alt="The Barcode of Life Project logo" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto">
                    <p>The Barcode of Life Project began in 2003, in the research lab of Prof. Paul Hebert, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Guelph in Ontario. It has now become a worldwide program, with research networks formed in many
                        countries. </p>
                    <h3 class="margin-top-xl">Practical applications of the Barcode for Life Project</h3>
                    <p>A recent application of this project has been in identifying species of fish for sale in seafood markets and restaurants around the world. Sometimes species are sold illegally or inexpensive species are given false names to hide their
                        true identity. In 2008, two New York City high school students used the freely available barcode database to prove that about one quarter of fish items they purchased in Manhattan were inaccurately labelled. Their “Sushigate”
                        investigation earned front-page coverage in <em class="Italic">The New York Times newspaper</em></p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_04.04.08.jpg" alt="The “Sushigate” investigation performed by two high school students proved that that about one quarter of fish items they purchased in Manhattan were inaccurately labelled.  Their research spawned further investigations. " class="img-responsive">
                    <p>One problem with biodiversity conservation is the difficulty that people have in identifying different species. Even highly trained specialists in taxonomy are limited to knowing only about 1,000 species, yet there are at least 10
                        million species on the planet. Endangered species may be living in threatened areas but may go unnoticed. This is especially true for insects, soil invertebrates, fungi, and small plants.</p>

                    <p>It takes many years to train a person in taxonomy and such training is very expensive. There aren’t enough highly trained people or enough time to train them, to address the biodiversity crisis facing us today. This is a particular
                        problem in developing nations where most of the world’s biodiversity exists. The Barcode of Life Project is seeking a way for everyone—trained or not—to be able to identify any one of millions of species in a few minutes, using hand-held
                        technology.</p>
                    <p>Large collaborative scientific projects like the Barcode of Life Project do not come about by chance. It requires a lot of hard work to bring partners together and get the research funding for a project like this. One important job is to
                        write scientific assessment reports, outlining the costs and benefits of the proposed research.</p>

                            <h3 class="margin-top-md">DNA barcoding: A new tool for cataloguing biodiversity</h3>
                            <p>It has taken over 250 years for scientists to catalogue only about 15% of the world’s biodiversity (GBA 1995). With so many species and ecosystems now under immediate threat, the worry is that most species will be extinct before they
                                can even be identified. Species identification is one of the first steps in biodiversity protection. To speed up species identification, a new genetics tool is being developed that will allow non-experts anywhere in the world to
                                quickly identify species of all kinds. DNA barcodes use a small fragment of an organism’s DNA—a portion of a single gene—to identify the species to which an organism belongs.</p>
                            <p>The Barcode of Life Project, started by Canadian researcher Paul Hebert at the University of Guelph, is developing a DNA-based identification system that can catalogue all species on earth using these barcodes (Dooh and Hebert 2005).
                            </p>
                            <p>With this technology, anyone anywhere could rapidly identify any species at any stage of development for less than 50 cents per sample (Dooh and Hebert 2005). This would make bioprospecting much more efficient and economical,
                                speeding up the discovery of organisms yielding life-saving drugs. Fast, cheap, and accurate identification of species will also help in controlling pests in agriculture, policing the illegal traffic in endangered species, and
                                promoting protection for species-rich areas that may have been overlooked.</p>
                            <p>This technology does not yet work for all species. Some plants and microbes may not have species-level barcodes in the sequences of DNA being examined. This requires more research. Also, barcoding does not replace the need for
                                researchers trained in taxonomy, phylogenetics, or ecology, as some have warned. In fact, because barcoding helps to catalogue biodiversity, it could provide an amazing new source of data that would greatly benefit research in these
                                fields (Hajibabaei et al. 2007).</p>
                            <p>The process began in Canada, and scientists here continue to lead international work aiming to catalogue the earth’s biodiversity. The DNA barcoding project provides a foundation for the creation of a complete inventory of
                                biodiversity in Canada, which would be the first inventory of its kind anywhere in the world. It is important that this work continue to be funded and develop.</p>

                    <p>Everyone in Canada working in a biotechnology lab is required to take a course in workplace health and safety so that they will know how to safely store, handle, and dispose of potentially dangerous substances. In particular, they must
                        demonstrate an understanding of Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) labels. WHMIS is a Canadian system of labeling that uses symbols to warn of potential threats to safety and health.</p>

                    <p>The extracted DNA contains the entire genome of the organism. Usually, it is not practical to work with all the genes. Often, researchers are only interested in studying one gene, or parts of a gene. Individual genes can be cut from the
                        chromosome using a specific <strong>restriction endonuclease </strong>(RE) enzyme. These enzymes work by recognizing and cutting a specific sequence of nucleotides at a location called a restriction site. Biologists use these enzymes as
                        “molecular scissors.” Many different kinds of endonucleases have been found, each targeting a different sequence.</p>
                    <p>Very small amounts of purified RE are used—around 1 microlitre (where 1 µl = 10<sup>–6</sup> L). The REs are added to the DNA sample, using a micropipette. A micropipette is a very accurate instrument that biologists use to transfer
                        small amounts of solution (1–1000 µl) from one location to another.</p>

                    <p>The DNA restriction fragments often have a few unpaired nucleotides at each end of the fragment. These short sequences, called <strong>sticky ends</strong>, allow the fragment to join with other DNA that has also been cut by the same RE.
                        The result is that the DNA fragments can be joined together—even with DNA from different species—to form new DNA called recombinant DNA.</p>

                    <h3>A closer look at gel electrophoresis </h3>
                    <p>Gel electrophoresis combines knowledge from the fields of chemistry and physics. You can think of it as an obstacle course for molecules. Negatively charged DNA molecules are forced to pass through a gelatin-like material called
                        <strong>agarose</strong>, which slows them down. The negatively charged molecules are pulled towards the positively charged end of the agarose gel. The larger molecules get blocked more easily, so they move through the gel more slowly.
                        Smaller molecules can avoid some obstacles, so they move through the gel more rapidly.
                    </p>
                    <p>The extracted DNA solution is forced to pass through the gel for a fixed period of time. Special imaging techniques are then used to see how far the different-sized fragments of DNA have moved. The result is that the different sizes of
                        DNA molecules are spread out across the gel in stripes or bands. The size of the DNA molecule making up each band can then be determined, in order to see if your sample contains the fragments you thought it did.</p>

                    <p>You usually need a lot of DNA material to perform genetic analyses, but sometimes the amount of DNA in your extraction is tiny. What you need is a fast way to make millions of copies of the DNA fragments in your sample (known as
                        amplifying), so that you can analyze it. The <strong>polymerase chain reaction</strong> (PCR) is a method of replicating specific sequences within a DNA sample. The invention of PCR in 1984 revolutionized genetic research. Kary Mullis
                        (USA) won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for inventing PCR, which is now routinely used in biology labs around the world.</p>

                    <h4>Overview of the polymerase chain reaction</h4>
                    <p>PCR works by amplifying a particular sequence of DNA selected by the researcher. The selection is done using a customized DNA primer, which is similar to RNA primers in DNA replication (which you learned about earlier) but is
                        artificially made. Each primer is designed to bind only to a specific sequence on the DNA. This ensures that only the DNA sequence of interest gets amplified. The DNA sequence is then replicated, through an automated series of steps, at
                        temperatures much higher than those naturally occurring in a cell. The high temperatures speed up the replication process significantly.</p>

                        primers, and free DNA nucleotides in vials alternately heated and then cooled. He found that, by doing so, the rate of DNA replication was increased exponentially, producing millions of copies of his target DNA fragment in a few hours.

                            enzymes helicase and topoisomerase. </li>
                        <li>The temperature is then lowered to 60°C, which allows the primer to bind to the template DNA strand at the correct location. This is called the annealing temperature, because the primer anneals (binds) to the DNA. </li>
                        <li>The temperature is then raised to 72°C, which is the optimal temperature for the Taq polymerase to start adding DNA nucleotides at the 3’ end of the template strand. This elongation process is completed in a few minutes and the result
                            is a doubling of the target DNA in the sample.</li>
                        <li>The whole process is repeated, cycling the vial’s temperature between 94°C, 60°C, and 72°C, over the course of a few minutes.</li>

                    <p>This process results in an exponential increase in the amount of DNA in the sample, because with every repetition of the cycle, the amount of target DNA gets doubled. Normally, this process is repeated about 30 to 35 times, yielding
                        billions of copies of the target DNA in only a few hours. New machines called <strong>thermocyclers</strong> automatically take a sample of vials throughout the three temperature stages and repeat the cycle as often as desired.</p>

                        <p>The unique feature of the Taq polymerase enzyme that makes PCR possible is that its optimal activity occurs at a high temperature (around 72°C). Most enzymes denature (split apart) above 40°C. Therefore, the DNA sample being amplified
                            can be separated cleanly by raising the temperature, while the activity of the enzyme is improved. This speeds up the replication process greatly.</p>

                        <p>PCR requires three steps and each one occurs at a different optimal temperature. The first step is to denature or split apart the DNA molecule. At 94°C, this will happen naturally, without the use of enzymes. The next step is the
                            attachment of the primer molecule to the exposed DNA templates. This is called annealing and happens most effectively at around 60°C. The final step is the addition of new nucleotides to the growing DNA strand. This elongation step

                    <h3>Technique 4: Sequencing</h3>
                    <p>Once a segment of DNA has been extracted and amplified, it is relatively easy to sequence it. You may want to know the sequence to understand a gene or to identify a particular individual (such as occurs in DNA fingerprinting). DNA
                        sequencing is a relatively new technology that has opened a new era in genetics and biotechnology. Perhaps the most famous application of this new technology was the Human Genome Project. This project aimed to obtain the sequence of the
                        entire human genome—all 3 billion base pairs. It took thousands of researchers many years to achieve this, but by 2003, it was complete. Since then, the complete genetic sequence of other important species has been obtained, including
                        that of the mouse, fruit fly and various crop plants.</p>

                    <p>The basis for DNA sequencing was initially developed by Frederick Sanger in Britain, in the 1970s. It is now called <strong>chain termination sequencing</strong> and uses a modified form of the polymerase chain reaction.</p>
                    <h3 class="margin-top-xl">Chain termination sequencing</h3>
                    <p>The process of chain termination sequencing results in the creation of many short segments of the original DNA fragment called <strong>DNA oligonucleotides</strong>. Their lengths range from one base, right up to the entire sequence.</p>

                    <p>The key innovation in Sanger’s method was the use of <strong>dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs)</strong> as <strong>DNA chain terminators</strong>. The ddNTPs are like regular nucleotides, except that they don’t have a 3’-OH
                        bonding site for the next incoming phosphate group. This means that no other nucleotide can bind to them, so the elongation process of the DNA strand stops immediately after they are added.</p>

                                        <strong>capillary electrophoresis</strong>. With this technique, a sample is passed through a very thin tube (capillary) containing a special gel, which allows the smaller molecules to move through more quickly, while slowing the
                                        larger ones down. The result is that the oligonucleotides get sorted by size, with the shortest one coming out first.

                                    <p>In order to identify the last nucleotide in the oligonucleotide sequence, each ddNTP needs to be labelled in some unique way. One popular method is to attach small <strong>fluorescent molecules</strong> to the ddNTPs, using a
                                        different fluorescent colour for each of the four bases. When these <strong>fluorescent molecules</strong> are exposed to a strong light, like a laser, they fluoresce (glow), giving off a particular colour of light. A camera
                                        records the colour of light released as the oligonucleotides pass under the light source. The image below shows a typical output from a DNA sequencing reaction, using fluorescently labelled ddNTPs.</p>

                                    <p>The information from the camera output is converted by a computer into the four letters of the DNA sequence. The result is stored as a text file, containing hundreds or thousands of letters in one long string. This is the DNA

                    <h2>5. Recombinant DNA</h2>
                    <h3>Technique 5: Recombinant DNA</h3>
                    <p>Once biologists learned how to cut specific genes from chromosomes using restriction enzymes, the next step was to take individual genes from one genome and insert them into another genome. This process, called recombination, was developed
                        in 1973 by Boyer and Cohen (as described in the timeline). This was the beginning of recombinant DNA technology.</p>
                    <p> In 1978, Herbert Boyer achieved another first: he transferred human genes into a bacterium (E. coli) to create synthetic human insulin. This was the first human application of recombinant DNA technology. The genetically modified
                        bacteria are described as transgenic, because they contain genes from another species.</p>

                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_04.04.50.jpg" alt=" Synthetic Human Insulin was first produced by recombinant technology in 1978 using a bacterium (E. coli) and human insulin." class="img-responsive">
                    <p>In 1982, human insulin became the first commercially available genetically engineered product created using recombinant DNA techniques. Insulin is required by hundreds of thousands of diabetics daily. Making it in genetically engineered
                        microorganisms provides an allergy-free, abundant, and inexpensive supply. Since then, hundreds of kinds of transgenic organisms have been produced, mostly for use in agriculture and medicine.</p>

                    <h4>How foreign genes are inserted into a host organism</h4>
                    <p>The methods for inserting genes are different, depending on whether the genes are being inserted into prokaryotes (for example, bacteria) or eukaryotes (for example, crop plants and livestock). Since the genomes of prokaryotes are easier
                        to work with, they were the first group to have foreign, usually eukaryotic, genes inserted into their genome. The process for inserting foreign genes into eukaryotes uses a similar principle, so only the details for prokaryotes will be
                        dealt with here.</p>
                    <h4>Role of plasmids</h4>
                    <p>Not all the genetic material in bacteria is stored in their chromosomes. They also have structures called plasmids, which contain some genetic material. Plasmids are small circular ribbons of DNA (about 3 kbp long) that can move between
                        bacteria. Plasmids are separate from the chromosomal DNA but are also used by the bacteria to code for proteins. When the bacterium undergoes replication, the plasmid DNA is copied, along with the cell’s chromosomal DNA.</p>
                    <p>The key to recombinant DNA is the plasmid. Researchers use the same restriction enzyme (for example, the endonuclease, HindIII) to cut open the plasmid in a bacterium like E. coli, as well as cut up specific fragments of DNA in the
                        eukaryotic cell. This creates a plasmid and DNA fragments that all have sticky ends. These sticky ends can be joined together in a process called ligation. The enzyme ligase is used to guide the sticky ends through the rejoining process.
                        In this way, genes not normally found in the plasmid can be inserted into it to create a recombinant plasmid. The recombinant plasmid is called a vector, because it is the vehicle that carries the foreign gene into the bacteria.</p>
                    <h4>Expressing the new gene</h4>
                    <p>The recombinant plasmid vector is then placed in a culture medium where the bacterium takes in the plasmid. It is now treated as a normal part of the cell. The bacterium makes proteins from the new gene and replicates the plasmid, along
                        with its normal chromosomal DNA, during reproduction. This means that the new gene is now part of the permanent genetic makeup of that organism. Figure 12.6 summarizes the process of making the recombinant plasmid and inserting it into
                        the host bacterium.</p>

                    <p>Bacteria can reproduce once every 20 minutes, so, within hours, several million copies of the new gene can be made. The bacterial cells act as micro-factories, pumping out the desired protein as instructed by the foreign DNA. Technicians
                        can then isolate and purify the protein for a specific use.</p>

                    <h3>Regulation of biotechnology in Canada</h3>
                    <p>Canada has developed one of the best systems in the world for regulating biotechnology in order to protect people and the environment. The process for getting a biotechnology product approved for use in Canada is longer and more rigorous
                        than in most countries. For example, the cow growth hormone bovine somatotropin (BST) is approved for use in the U.S. but is banned in Canada.</p>
                    <p>Canada has several federal government agencies that are responsible for regulating biotechnology.</p>
                    <p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is responsible for the regulation of food products produced using biotechnology. This includes plants, animals, animal feeds, and animal medications. For example, for genetically modified crop
                        plants, the CFIA assesses the potential risk of environmental impacts. It also oversees import permits and research.</p>
                    <p>Health Canada is responsible for assessing the risks to human health of products produced using biotechnology. </p>
                    <p>This includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Foods</li>
                        <li>Drugs</li>
                        <li>Cosmetics</li>
                        <li>Medical devices,</li>
                        <li>Pest-control products. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To assess the safety and societal benefit of new types of bioengineered foods, the agency considers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the process used to develop the food</li>
                        <li>its nutritional quality</li>
                        <li>the presence of any toxins</li>
                        <li>the potential for allergic reactions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row ilc-row-text">
                <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1">
                    <p>There are also some misconceptions about GE foods among the public. For example, some people fear that just by eating a genetically engineered food, they will incorporate a foreign gene into their genetic code, but that is biologically
                        impossible. Just because a bacterial gene has been inserted into a tomato does not mean that the gene will somehow find its way into the consumer’s genome. Your genetic code does not get changed by the foods you eat.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_04.04.57.jpg" alt="GMO foods" class="img-responsive">
                    <p>This does not mean that all genetically engineered foods are safe, however. As with all new technology, sometimes unexpected consequences occur. For example, in 2000, U.S. researchers inserted an anti-freeze gene from the flounder, a
                        cold-water fish, into strains of strawberries and oranges to help them tolerate freezing. These genetically engineered fruits could then be grown in colder climates. Unfortunately, the fish’s anti-freeze protein that was being expressed
                        in the “fishfruit” could induce allergic reactions in people who were allergic to seafood. Because of this, these GE fruits were removed from agricultural production.</p>
                    <p>In theory, inserting the anti-freeze gene from flounder fish into strawberries was a good idea; however, fish’s anti-freeze protein that was being expressed in the “fishfruit” could induce allergic reactions in people who were allergic
                        to seafood. These GMO strawberries were removed from agricultural production.</p>
                    <p>Some people argue that the safety requirements imposed on GE foods are too strict. They say that common foods like peanuts and scallops also induce allergies in many people, but these foods are not banned from being sold. Consumer
                        protection advocates respond that labels on food products help people to avoid those foods that cause their allergies, but with GE foods, the consumer does not know what genes have been inserted into the food. Someone with a seafood
                        allergy could perhaps get a potentially deadly allergic reaction to a chocolate bar. How can consumer safety be guaranteed?</p>

People argue that labelling GMO foods is focusing on the how the food is processed or made instead of focusing on its content or ingredients. Others argue that consumers have a right to know if the food they eat is GMO to prevent allergic reactions" class="img-responsive">
                    <p>The answers are not simple. Each biotechnology application should be examined for its risks and benefits to society. We are now living in an era of rapid advancements in biotechnology and this will affect everyone.</p>
