                    <p>In the Meselson and Stahl experiment, what pattern of banding would you expect to find in the
                        centrifuge tubes after one generation in the regular nitrogen medium, if DNA replication were,
                        in fact, conservative?</p>

                        <p>If replication were conservative, there would be one band of heavy DNA and one band of
                            regular DNA in the centrifuge tubes. This would be because one copy would contain the
                            original heavy nitrogen, while the other copy would contain only the regular-weight
                            nitrogen.</p>

                    <h2>Stages in DNA replication</h2>
                    <p>The process of DNA replication in prokaryotes (organisms whose cells don&#x2019;t contain a
                        nucleus) and eukaryotes (organisms whose cells contain a nucleus) is similar, even though they
                        have differently shaped DNA. Prokaryotes have circular strands of DNA and contain about a
                        thousand times fewer nucleotides than the long, twisted strands of DNA found in eukaryotes.
                        Because of this, DNA replication in prokaryotes is much faster, usually taking less than an
                        hour, while in eukaryotes it takes a few hours.</p>
                    <p>The process of DNA replication in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes can be broken down into three
                        main phases:</p>
                    <p><strong>Initiation:</strong> DNA is unwound and separated to expose each strand in the pair at
                        multiple sites of replication along the DNA molecule.</p>
                    <p><strong>Elongation:</strong> Enzymes attach complementary nucleotides onto the 3&#x2019; (three
                        prime) end of
                        each exposed strand in a linear sequence, and check for errors.</p>
                    <p><strong>Termination:</strong> Nucleotide addition stops, enzymes are removed, and the newly
                        formed strands of DNA coil back into the double helix shape.</p>
                    <p>Next you will get into the details of the stages of DNA replication. To begin, you must perform
                        your own research, or watch one (or more) of the following videos to get an overview of the
                        three
                        stages in DNA replication. You will take a detailed look at the three stages after. Copy the
                        table below into your notebook to help guide your research. Once you are able to complete the

                                    <p>The first phase in replicating DNA is to unwind and open up the molecule so that
                                        the nucleotide base pairs on each strand can be exposed. You might think that
                                        the easiest way to do this would be to start at one end of the DNA and split it
                                        apart, like unzipping a zipper. This can work, but the process of replication
                                        would then be very slow because there would be only one replication site along
                                        the entire length of the DNA molecule, occurring just where the two strands are
                                        separating.</p>
                                    <p>If replication occurred at only one replication site, it would take about one
                                        month to replicate the 200 million base pairs in a typical strand of eukaryotic
                                        DNA, and several days to replicate the shorter prokaryotic DNA. That is because
                                        in eukaryotic cells, only about 80 nucleotides per second can be added at a
                                        replication site. In prokaryotes, the rate is about 10 times faster because the
                                        DNA is not packaged in chromatin.</p>

                                    <p>Taking days or weeks to replicate DNA is far too long for meeting the
                                        needs of growth and development in organisms, some of which may only
                                        live for a few days. The solution is to have hundreds or even thousands
                                        of replication sites along the length of a DNA molecule, all replicating
                                        different parts of the molecule at the same time. In this way, the
                                        molecule can be copied in hours, instead of days or weeks.</p>

                                    <p>The multiple DNA replication sites are called the <strong>origins of
                                            replication</strong> and occur all along the DNA molecule. They are
                                        located in areas with lots of A-T base pairs, because these nucleotides
                                        are held together with only two hydrogen bonds, so they are easier to
                                        pull apart than C-G base pairs, which are held together by three
                                        hydrogen bonds.</p>

                                    <p>At each origin of replication point, the double-stranded DNA is unwound
                                        and separated by the enzyme <strong>helicase</strong>. Helicase uses
                                        ATP energy to break the hydrogen bonds joining the base pairs at the
                                        origins of replication. As a result, the two strands split apart,
                                        creating two prongs that resemble a fork. This is called the
                                        <strong>replication fork</strong>.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>When helicase opens up the DNA molecule somewhere in the middle, a bubble
                                        containing two replication forks is formed in the DNA, one on each side
                                        of the bubble. Hundreds to thousands of these bubbles, called
                                        replication bubbles, form simultaneously along the DNA molecule and each
                                        one is a site at which replication can occur. Eventually, the bubbles
                                        grow wide enough to merge and the segments of daughter strands of DNA
                                        connect together to form a new complete strand.</p>

                                    <p>There is a lot of activity occurring near the replication fork. For
                                        example, the enzyme <strong>helicase</strong> unwinds the DNA as it
                                        separates it. However, this causes some twisting and super-coiling to
                                        accumulate further ahead, along the DNA. If this coiling were to
                                        continue uncontrolled, it would eventually get so hard to twist the
                                        molecule further that replication would have to stop. In order to
                                        eliminate this coiling stress, another type of enzyme, called
                                        <strong>topoisomerase, </strong>moves along the DNA, just ahead of the
                                        helicase, cutting the DNA and relaxing the coils. In prokaryotes, and
                                        some eukaryotes, the particular type of topoisomerase that does this job
                                        is called <strong>gyrase.</strong>

                                    <p>Since the natural tendency of single-stranded DNA is to form hydrogen
                                        bonds with its exposed bases, there is a danger that the split DNA will
                                        simply re-anneal (join back together) or bond with other molecules in
                                        the nucleoplasm and become degraded. To prevent the base pairs from
                                        re-annealing and becoming degraded after the helicase enzyme has
                                        separated the strands, <strong>single-stranded DNA binding proteins

                                        bubbles. The SSBs help prevent the two template parent DNA strands from
                                        re-establishing hydrogen bonds and protect the exposed bases until they
                                        are ready to bond with their complementary nucleotides.</p>

                                    <p>DNA polymerase III can only add nucleotides onto an existing DNA strand; it
                                        cannot begin the synthesis of a new strand. To begin the synthesis of a new
                                        strand, there must be a starting sequence of nucleotides for DNA polymerase III
                                        to attach to. This starting sequence is provided by a short fragment of RNA that
                                        is created and attached to the exposed template strand to serve as the starting
                                        nucleotides from which DNA polymerase III can extend outwards.</p>
                                    <p>The short fragment of RNA is called an <strong>RNA primer</strong>, which is
                                        about 10 to 100 base pairs long and is complementary to a section of the exposed
                                        template strand. The formation of this RNA primer requires the enzyme
                                        <strong>primase</strong>. Once the RNA primer is formed and attached to the DNA
                                        template, the primase enzyme is released.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The two strands of newly forming DNA (leading and lagging) are both assembled
                                        simultaneously using DNA polymerase; however, because of their different
                                        orientations, the process and speed is not the same on each strand. The details
                                        of each are described next.</p>

                                    <h5>Leading strand </h5>
                                    <p>On the leading strand, DNA polymerase III continuously adds nucleotides, starting
                                        from the initial RNA primer. It joins a new nucleotide to the existing chain of
                                        nucleotides by catalyzing the formation of phosphodiester bonds at the 3&#x2019;
                                        end, between the last nucleotide on the chain and the new deoxyribonucleoside
                                        triphosphate. Since this is the natural orientation of the leading strand, the
                                        process can continue easily along this strand in the same direction as the
                                        replication fork. When replication is finished, the RNA primer is replaced with
                                        DNA.</p>
                                    <h5>Lagging strand </h5>
                                    <p>The lagging strand does not have the 3&#x2019; end exposed on its last
                                        nucleotide; it has the 5&#x2019; end, where it can&#x2019;t add new nucleotides.
                                        Because of this, adding more nucleotides to the growing strand requires a
                                        four-step process involving several more enzymes. </p>
                                    <p>As with the leading strand, the DNA synthesis on the lagging strand starts with
                                        the creation of short pieces of RNA templates that attach along the exposed
                                        template of the lagging strand. The RNA templates serve as starting points for
                                        the addition of new nucleotides. The lagging strand is then synthesized
                                        discontinuously in short fragments in the opposite direction to the leading
                                        strand (that is, away from the fork). Eventually, the short fragments are
                                        attached together to form the new DNA strand. It is because of these extra steps
                                        that this strand takes longer to assemble, which is why it lags behind the
                                        leading strand.</p>

                                    <p>DNA Polymerase III prevents point mutations by detecting the number of hydrogen
                                        bonds a nucleotide forms. If hydrogen bonding does not occur, the bases are

                                    <p>Like all reactions in living cells, DNA replication takes place in a chemical
                                        environment that is very chaotic. During this process, millions of molecules of
                                        phosphates, nucleotides, RNA, and enzymes are all colliding around each other.
                                        In this environment it is possible for errors in DNA replication to occur, with
                                        the occasional wrong nucleotide being added to the growing template. Errors in
                                        copying the genetic code are called <strong>point mutations</strong> and can be
                                        very dangerous for the organism, so mechanisms have evolved to catch errors as
                                        they happen.</p>
                                    <p>DNA polymerase III can detect if the nucleotide it has just added to the growing
                                        strand has formed hydrogen bonds with its counterpart on the template strand. If
                                        hydrogen bonding does not occur, it means that the bases are mismatched, so DNA
                                        polymerase III removes the incorrect nucleotide and replaces it with the correct
                                        one. This continuous error-checking process is so good that only about one error
                                        per billion base pairs occurs.</p>

                                    <h4>Removing the RNA primer from the 5&#x2019; end of daughter DNA</h4>
                                    <p> <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_04.02.30.jpg" alt=" " class="img-responsive"></p>
                                    <p>Each DNA replication results in a slightly shorter daughter molecule because
                                        there is no way to fill in the 5&#x2019; end with nucleotides once the RNA
                                        primer is removed.</p>
                                    <p>As you saw in step three of elongation, an important act in replication is to
                                        remove the RNA primer from the end of a newly formed section and replace it with
                                        DNA. However, when the RNA primer is removed from the 5&#x2019; end of each
                                        daughter DNA molecule, there is no adjacent nucleotide chain with a 3&#x2019;
                                        end that can be extended to fill in the gap. This means that there is a gap at
                                        the 5&#x2019; end of each DNA molecule that remains unpaired with the template
                                        strand.</p>

                                    <p>The gap is as long as the RNA primer. Eventually, the unpaired nucleotides on the
                                        template strand break off, leaving the daughter DNA molecule a little shorter
                                        than its parent. So, with each replication, the DNA gets a bit shorter. In
                                        humans, about 100 base pairs are lost from each end of each chromosome every
                                        time DNA replicates.</p>
                                    <p>Prokaryotes, like bacteria, do not suffer from this problem, because their DNA is
                                        circular, so there are no ends with gaps left exposed.</p>
                                    <p>Even though 100 base pairs do not seem like a lot when compared to the millions
                                        of base pairs that make up eukaryotic chromosomes, their loss over time could
                                        result in significant genetic damage. For this reason, eukaryotic organisms have
                                        evolved special regions at the end of their chromosomes called telomeres that
                                        help to deal with this problem.</p>

                        DNA replication. In humans, the sequence is TTAGGG </p>
                    <p>A telomere is a region of several thousand nucleotides made up of a simple repeated sequence that
                        does not code for proteins. In humans, the sequence is <strong>TTAGGG.</strong> This acts as a
                        buffer region of expendable DNA that can be gradually lost over repeated replications without
                        damaging the active genetic code.</p>
                    <p>Telomeres are of finite length, which means that cells are only able to divide a certain number
                        of times before the DNA loss prevents further division. Cells die when their telomeres become
                        too short to support further cell division. Cells with longer telomeres live longer. When you
                        were born, your telomeres were longer than they are now, and with every division since then,
                        they have been getting slightly smaller.</p>
                    <p>Some cells, like reproductive cells, need to be able to replicate their DNA more times than
                        somatic cells, so they produce an enzyme called telomerase that extends the telomeres.</p>
