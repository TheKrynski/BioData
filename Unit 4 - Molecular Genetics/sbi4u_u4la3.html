                    <p>How many different letters do you notice in the image above?</p>
                    <p>Those four letters above – A, C, G, and T – represent each of the different types of nucleic acids that make up DNA, which is responsible for all the incredible diversity of life. </p>
                    <p>How is it that the “language” of DNA only has 4 letters, but we see such a huge amount of diversity? </p>
                    <p>You've already learned that proteins are formed by long chains of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds and then folded together. DNA is made up of nucleic acids, of which there are four types. DNA is like a recipe for amino
                        acids. Each amino acid is specified by a three nucleic acid “word” called a codon. Try the activity below to see how complex messages can be represented with a simple system of four letters and three-letter words.</p>

                    <h2>The importance of protein synthesis</h2>
                    <p>The information stored in genes can only be useful to a cell if it is read and turned into proteins. DNA is like an architect’s plan for a house; it tells the builders how to construct it. But the genes themselves cannot assemble a
                        protein on their own any more than an architect’s drawing can pick up a hammer and start building a house. Both genes and architectural drawings need builders to turn their plans into reality. Within cells, there is an extensive set of
                        biochemicals that builds proteins, based on the instructions read from the DNA. This process is called <strong>protein synthesis</strong>.</p>
                    <p><img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_04.03.03.jpg" alt="Blueprints and DNA are similar because they both consist of detailed information on how to build houses and proteins, respectively.  Engineers use the information in a blueprint to build houses and biochemical reactions in the cell help to build proteins based on the information stored in DNA genes." class="img-responsive"></p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row ilc-row-text">
                <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1">
                    <p>Not all the genes in a cell are synthesized into proteins. Another way to say this is that the genes are not “expressed.” For example, the cone cells in your eye have the same set of genetic instructions as the insulin-producing cells in
                        your pancreas, but your eye can’t manage blood glucose levels any more than your pancreas can help you to see. So how do the cone cells know that they should do only one job, when their DNA contains the information for doing every job?
                        The answer lies in <strong>gene expression</strong>. Somehow, just the right genes are read at just the right time to make the proteins needed for that cell, at that moment. The way that genes are expressed depends on a complex
                        interaction between the genetic code and environmental conditions.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_04.03.04.jpg" alt="The information in DNA is coded into genes.  Gene expression depends on complex interaction between the genetic code and environmental conditions and dictates which proteins are need for a cell at particular point in time." class="img-responsive">
                    <p>Biologists are discovering the importance of understanding gene expression. When genes are being expressed and are creating proteins, geneticists say they are “turned on,” and when they are not, they are “turned off.” </p>
                    <p><img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_04.03.05.jpg" alt="Genes can be turned on and off just like a light switch" class="img-responsive"></p>
                    <p>Understanding what causes genes to turn on and off has the potential to explain how we develop and age, as well as explaining the origins of many important diseases like cancer and heart disease. </p>

                    <p>The excitement over the potential medical breakthroughs offered by understanding gene expression has biologists intensively studying all aspects of the protein synthesis process, particularly the roles of RNA. In 2010, University of
                        Toronto researchers announced that they had cracked the “second genetic code,” which lets them predict how a gene will be expressed under different conditions. Their discovery solves a mystery that had been around since the human genome
                        was sequenced and found to contain only 20,000 genes. Other simpler species, like trees, can have three times that amount. How can humans create organs as complex as brains, using so few genes? The answer is that each gene can be
                        expressed in many ways, depending on what happens to the RNA.</p>
                    <p>Before you learn the technical details of protein synthesis, it helps to first get an overview of the whole process and to learn about some of the discoveries that got us to this point.</p>

                    <p>Recall that proteins are made of polypeptides, which are long chains of amino acids joined together by peptide bonds. The sequence of amino acids determines the protein’s final shape and function. The sequence of amino acids for a
                        protein is coded in the DNA. <strong>Protein synthesis</strong> <em class="Italic">is the process by which the genetic code in the DNA is decoded through different kinds of RNA into amino acids and eventually, proteins.</em></p>

                    <p>The process of protein synthesis follows a one-way sequence from DNA to protein (Figure below). This process is not reversible. Changes in DNA can result in changes in the protein, but changes in the protein will not change the DNA.</p>

                    <p>The overall process summarized in the image was proposed by Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA. He called this two-step process the “<strong>central dogma</strong>” of genetics. By this he meant that it was a
                        powerful theory, but at the time had little experimental support. That experimental evidence has since been found, proving Crick right.</p>

                    <h3>Early research into protein synthesis</h3>
                    <p>When Gregor Mendel published his work on the inheritance of physical traits in pea plants, he showed that <em class="Italic">discrete genes were responsible for discrete phenotypic characteristics</em>. This was the first time that
                        anyone had demonstrated a relationship between <strong>genotype</strong> and <strong>phenotype</strong>. The next step would be to find the type of molecules that were determined by the genes.</p>
                    <p>That step was reached in the early 1900s when a British doctor, Archibald Garrod, hypothesized that protein was the type of molecule determined by the genes. He noticed that certain illnesses were more common in some families than
                        others, indicating that the illnesses were inherited. Garrod studied patients suffering from a rare genetic disease that caused their urine to turn black when exposed to air. He identified a mutation in a gene coding for the enzyme
                        (protein) involved in the metabolism of urine production.</p>
                    <p>He showed that these patients were unable to produce the correct form of the enzyme because the gene responsible for it was faulty.</p>

                    <h3>One gene-one polypeptide hypothesis</h3>
                    <p>Garrod’s work showed that genes somehow coded for proteins, but exactly how this happened remained a mystery for the next 40 years. The work of American researchers George Beadle and Edward Tatum in the 1940s revealed the <em class="Italic">one-to-one relationship between genes and proteins</em>.</p>
                    <p>Beadle and Tatum studied how different genetic strains of a bread mould synthesized an amino acid, arginine. Four enzymes are needed to fully synthesize arginine along a biochemical pathway. They isolated four mutant strains of the
                        moulds and showed that each one lacked the ability to make one of the four enzymes. They also showed that each strain had a mutation in a different gene, and that each mutation only affected one enzyme. The pattern they detected of one
                        gene affecting only one enzyme is now called the <em class="Italic">one gene-one polypeptide hypothesis</em>. </p>
                    <p>Since then, research has shown that in some cases, one gene can code for more than one polypeptide. You will learn more about this in later sections.</p>

                    <h3>How mutations cause disease</h3>
                    <p>How a mutation in one gene can be responsible for a human disease was first shown in 1956 by Vernon Ingram. Ingram compared the amino acid sequences of the protein <strong>hemoglobin</strong> (the molecule that carries oxygen in red
                        blood cells) in people with healthy red blood cells to those with a genetic disease called <strong>sickle-cell anemia</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Ingram used the technique of electrophoresis to determine the amino acid sequence of the polypeptides that make up the protein. He found that the patients with sickle-cell anemia differed from the healthy patients in <em class="Italic">only one amino acid on one polypeptide chain in hemoglobin</em>. In healthy patients, the amino acid glutamate is present at a certain location on the β-hemoglobin polypeptide, but in patients with sickle-cell anemia,
                        that location contains the amino acid, valine, instead. </p>

                    <p>This one change in the amino acid sequence changes the way in which the resulting polypeptide coils up. This affects its shape and ultimately affects the way that the hemoglobin protein functions. This was the first time that a
                        researcher had demonstrated that a single amino acid exchange in a protein can cause a disease or disorder.</p>

                    <h3>Discovering the genetic code</h3>
                    <p>To early researchers, the DNA sequence was a mysterious string of nucleotide bases, like letters of the alphabet in a foreign language. They knew that sections of the sequence must code for individual proteins and that within those
                        sections, groups of letters must code for individual amino acids, but they did not know how this was done. They had found the alphabet but couldn’t recognize the words. The challenge now was to crack the genetic code and find the words
                        among the letters.</p>

                    <p>Francis Crick proposed that three sequential nucleotide letters (for example, ACG) made up a unit that coded for a particular amino acid. He called these units <strong>codons</strong>. Crick’s proposal was called the <em class="Italic">triplet hypothesis</em>. He based his hypothesis on the fact that DNA contained four different letters and there were 20 different amino acids.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If only one nucleotide were used to code for an amino acid, then DNA could only code for four different amino acids.</li>
                        <li>If two nucleotides combined to form a codon, then that would give 4 × 4 =16 different combinations, but again, not enough to code for all 20 amino acids.</li>
                        <li>However, if three nucleotides together formed a codon, then they would be able to code for 4 × 4 × 4 = 64 different amino acids. This was more than enough. Crick tested his hypothesis in experiments on bacteria and, in 1961, he was
                            able to confirm that the triplet hypothesis was correct.</li>

                    <p>Later the same year, two other researchers, Marshall Nirenberg and Har Gobind Khorana, were able to identify the triplet letter sequences (codons) that coded for each of the 20 amino acids. For their work in discovering the genetic code,
                        they received the Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine in 1968.</p>
                    <p>The table below shows the codons used to code for each amino acid. (<strong>Note</strong>: You do <strong>not</strong> have to memorize the contents of this table for this course). Because amino acids are actually coded for using RNA
                        instead of DNA, there is one change in the base pairs used in the coding. The nucleotide thymine (T) in DNA is replaced with uracil (U) in RNA.</p>
                    <p>Because there are 64 potentially different codons and only 20 different amino acids, there is some redundancy in the codes. Most amino acids can be coded by more than one codon. This <em class="Italic">redundancy</em> helps to reduce the
                        impact of minor mutations, since not all mutations will result in changes in the amino acid sequence. Only three codons do not code for any amino acid. These codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA) are used to make protein synthesis <em class="Italic">stop</em>. One codon, AUG, is used to indicate the <em class="Italic">start</em> of the protein synthesis sequence, as well as coding for methionine.</p>

                    <p>In the table above, each three-letter codon is read from left to right across the columns of the table, indicating their positions within the codon. For example, the codon CAU codes for histidine, CAA codes for glutamine, and UGG codes

                    <p>At first, it was thought that this genetic code was universal—that all organisms used the same codons to code for the same amino acids. A few exceptions have been found in the genetic codes in mitochondria and chloroplasts but, generally
                        speaking, this genetic code is the same in all organisms.</p>

                        <p>The one gene-one polypeptide hypothesis says that one gene is responsible for producing one polypeptide.</p>
                        <p> One example is the studies done by researchers Beadle and Tatum, who studied how different genetic strains of a bread mould synthesized an amino acid, arginine. Four enzymes are needed to fully synthesize arginine along a biochemical
                            pathway. They isolated four mutant strains of the moulds and showed that each one lacked the ability to make one of the four enzymes. They also showed that each strain had a mutation in a different gene, and that each mutation only
                            affected one enzyme. The pattern they detected of one gene affecting only one enzyme is now called the one gene-one polypeptide hypothesis. Vernon Ingram was the researcher who discovered that the disease known as sickle-cell anemia was
                            the product of individual faulty genes coding for individual amino acids that make up one of the β-hemoglobin polypeptides. Each mutation in a gene corresponded to a change in only one amino acid.</p>

                        <li>The second main stage, translation, happens in the cytoplasm. This is where the genetic information in the RNA gets translated into a sequence of amino acids and eventually, a protein.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This flow-chart represents the overall pathway for protein synthesis:</p>

                    <p>You may be asking yourself why the eukaryotic cell bothers with this two-stage process. Wouldn’t it be easier if the DNA were directly translated into proteins in the cytoplasm, instead of using RNA as an intermediate step? The answer is
                        no, for many reasons. A main reason is that the cytoplasm is a very dangerous place for DNA molecules. There are lots of enzymes and chemicals floating around that could permanently damage the DNA molecules and so destroy the recipe
                        needed to keep the cell alive. That is why eukaryotic DNA is kept safely stored in the nucleus, protected by the nuclear membrane. RNA works like a temporary and throw-away copy of the DNA.</p>

                                                    <p>Unlike in DNA replication, the RNA polymerase does not need a primer to start adding nucleotides.</p>

                                                        <li>RNA polymerase unravels the coiled DNA as it moves along, forming a transcription bubble behind it. Only the small segment of DNA being actively transcribed by the RNA polymerase is exposed during transcription. </li>
                                                        <li>Free-floating RNA nucleotides are added to the 3’ end of the growing mRNA strand as the RNA polymerase moves down the DNA template strand in the 3’ to 5’ direction. </li>
                                                        <li>When adenine (A) is encountered in the DNA, RNA polymerase adds the nucleotide uracil (U), instead of thymine (T), to the growing mRNA strand. </li>
                                                        <li>Just like in DNA replication, phosphodiester bonds between the 5’ phosphate and 3’ OH group of the previous nucleotide are formed to join the mRNA nucleotides together.</li>
                                                        <li>The two DNA strands quickly rejoin and rewind into their double-helix form once the polymerase has moved on. This is essential because harmful enzymes (endonucleases) floating inside the nucleus would destroy any
                                                            exposed DNA.</li>
                                                        <li>When the bubble closes up, another RNA polymerase enzyme can attach and start transcribing the same gene again. In this way, many thousands of mRNA molecules can be transcribed from the same gene in a short amount of
                                                            time.</li>

                                    <p>In eukaryotes, the mRNA must be modified in two ways before it leaves the nucleus to start making polypeptides in the cytoplasm.</p>

                                        <li>Protecting mRNA against enzymes</li>

                                    <h4>Protecting mRNA against enzymes </h4>
                                    <p>The first modification involves protecting the mRNA against enzymes. The cytoplasm is rich with nucleases and phosphatases, enzymes that can break apart any unprotected RNA or DNA strands. The presence of these enzymes in the
                                        same area where protein synthesis occurs may seem counterproductive, but cells have evolved these enzymes to protect themselves from infection by viral DNA and RNA. </p>
                                    <p>Protection against the enzymes is done by placing extra nucleotide sequences on both ends of the mRNA molecule. This is done using other enzymes which add: </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>a protective cap (guanine triphosphate (GTP)) at the 5’ end</li>
                                        <li>a long series of repeating adenine nucleotides, called a poly-A tail, at the 3’ end. </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_04.03.21.jpg" alt="mRNA is protected against enzymes in the nucleus with a GTP protective cap at the 5’ end and a poly-A tail at the 3’ tail of the mRNA" class="img-responsive" style="margin: auto">
                                    <p>The extra nucleotide sequence on both ends of the mRNA molecule:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>protects the mRNA from damage in the cytoplasm. </li>

                                    <h4>Removing non-coding DNA called introns</h4>
                                    <p>The second modification involves the code itself. </p>
                                    <p>Eukaryotic genes include regions of non-coding DNA called introns, which are stretches of DNA that do not get translated into proteins. </p>
                                    <p>Introns separate coding regions called exons, which do get translated into proteins. </p>
                                    <p>Since introns and extrons are both transcribed into the original mRNA molecule, the introns must be removed before translation can occur.</p>
                                    <p>Removal of the introns occurs using particles made of RNA combined with a protein called spliceosomes. Spliceosomes cut out the introns and join up the remaining exons to form a continuous coding sequence on the mRNA.</p>
                                    <p>The following figure summarizes the sequence of the two post-transcriptional modifications in eukaryotes.</p>

                                    <p>The resulting mRNA is now called the <strong>mRNA transcript</strong>, which is ready to be sent out to the cytoplasm for the translation stage in protein synthesis. This system may seem unusual, but it turns out that these exons
                                        can be rearranged and joined together in different arrangements with the result that the approximately 20,000 genes in humans can produce around 120,000 different proteins! Understanding how RNA is modified after transcription
                                        promises to be one of the biggest discoveries in genetics since the discovery of DNA.</p>
                                    <p>In prokaryotes, the final process is a bit different. They lack a nucleus so their DNA is always in the cytoplasm, where ribosomes can actually bind to the growing mRNA strand and begin translation before RNA polymerase has even
                                        finished transcribing the entire mRNA strand.</p>

                                    <p>The modified mRNA transcript enters the cytoplasm where a ribosome attaches to it. <strong>Ribosomes</strong> are complexes of proteins and RNA (called ribosomal RNA or rRNA), arranged into two parts called the large and small
                                        subunits. The ribosome is the structure on which amino acids get joined together to form the desired polypeptide chain. </p>

                                    <p>The whole initiation process is quite complex, but can be broken down into three steps:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Step 1: Ribosome begins attachment to mRNA</li>

                                    <p>Elongation continues until a stop or termination codon is encountered on the mRNA transcript. In the following image you can see that there are three “stop” codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA). A special protein release factor recognizes

                    <h2>The regulation of protein synthesis</h2>
                    <p>Every living cell can respond to its environment by changing the types and amounts of protein it produces through changes in its gene expression. For example, some proteins are only necessary during key moments in a cell’s life cycle,
                        while others may be needed constantly. As you have probably recognized, the process of protein synthesis is energetically costly for organisms. Anabolic (building) processes require energy. Because of the high cost of making proteins,
                        they are only made when necessary. So, how does a cell know to produce a protein only when needed? How does the cell start or stop the processes of protein synthesis?</p>
                    <p>Regulation of protein synthesis occurs at four different levels of control: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Transcriptional</li>

                    <p><em class="Italic">An </em><strong>operon</strong><em class="Italic"> is a group of genes under the control of a single regulatory protein</em>. The result is that the genes contained in the operon are either expressed together or not at

                        variations to drive evolution.</p>
                    <p>There are essentially two classes of mutations: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Gene-level mutations</strong>: mistakes in the base-pair sequence of genes</li>
                        <li><strong>Chromosome-level mutations</strong>: are mistakes in the arrangement or number of genes on a chromosome.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Both are described in more detail in the next sections.</p>

                    <h3>Gene-level mutations </h3>
                    <p>Mutations within a gene happen when one or more bases are replaced with the wrong nucleotides. The effect of this mutation can range from no effect, all the way up to a complete misreading of the entire gene. This level of mutation only
                        affects the one gene.</p>
                    <p>There are two major types of gene-level mutations:&#160;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Point Mutations (Substitution Mutations)</li>
                        <li>Frameshift Mutations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To help you understand how they work, here is a DNA coding sequence for a normal segment of insulin. You will see how various gene-level mutations change the way that this coding sequence is translated into proteins.</p>

                    <p>Mutations in the structure of the chromosome can affect many genes. These mutations occur during meiosis. Chromosomal mutations can produce rapid genetic changes that lead to the development of new species. </p>

                    <p>This occurs when there is a <em class="Italic">relocation of groups of base pairs </em>from one part of the chromosome to the other. It was thought that genes were fixed in one predictable location on the chromosome. Barbara McClintock’s
                        discovery in the late 1940s that genes could move from one location to another within the genome was quite surprising. In 1983, Dr. McClintock was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine for her discovery of short segments of
                        moveable DNA, known as transposons. Many of these translocations occur normally within meiotic division.</p>

                    <p>This occurs when a segment on the chromosome is cut out, and then turned around and reinserted backwards. The result is that it has reversed its orientation in the chromosome by flipping from 5’ – 3’ to 3’ – 5’. This also happens during
                        meiosis.</p>

                        <p>The new sixth DNA codon would be AAG. This would change the mRNA codon from UUU to UUC, but due to redundancy in the genetic code, both of these mRNA codons would code for the same amino acid, phenylalanine. This results in a silent
                            mutation, because there would be no change in the polypeptide.</p>
