        <h1>Assessment for feedback</h1>
        <p>This is an assessment for feedback, but not marks. Feedback and suggestions for improvement will be provided by the teacher. This assessment relates to the benefits of whole eggs vs. plain egg whites and will require you to perform
          research using both primary and secondary sources.</p>
        <p>In this assessment you will research the relative health benefits of whole eggs (egg whites and yolk) compared to eating just egg whites. Your task is to find one scholarly journal article (primary source) and at least 3 news articles
          (secondary sources) related to the scholarly journal article on the topic of comparing the benefits of whole eggs to plain egg whites. </p>
        <p>Below are some suggested primary and secondary sourced articles but you may also choose to find the primary and secondary sources based on your own research.</p>

        <h2>Journal review</h2>
        <p>Step 1: Review the journal (scholarly article) first and create a vocabulary list or glossary of terms that are new to you, or that have been learned in this course. You can research the words to find the meaning, but the definition should
          be in your own words and simplified so that it makes sense to you. Include 15 words. </p>
        <p>Step 2: Read the journal article again and complete this <a href="../assets/locker_docs/sbi4u_04.06.01.pdf" target="_blank">graphic organizer<span class="sr-only"> (Opens in new window)</span></a> to help you understand the article.</p>
        <p>There may be parts you cannot understand, and that is ok. Reading scientific journals is difficult for those in university too. This is why you are practicing this skill now. You will need to work through it slowly. You will get feedback
          on this activity and have time to improve your responses based on that feedback. </p>
        <h2>Compare media articles</h2>
        <p>Review the three news articles about the study. <a href="../assets/locker_docs/sbi4u_04.06.02.pdf" target="_blank">Compare the features of the articles <span class="sr-only"> (Opens in new window)</span></a>and complete the graphic
          organizer based on the comparison. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row ilc-row-text">
      <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1">
        <h2>Writing a summary </h2>
        <p>Write a paragraph that summarizes the journal article you have just completed the graphic organizer for. </p>
        <p>Use the following success criteria to guide your summary writing work. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>There is an introduction, body, and conclusion </li>
          <li>Most important facts/ ideas are included </li>
          <li>The summary is written in my own words </li>
          <li>Facts are organized in a logical order </li>
          <li>There is a reflection to the information in the summary - a reflection about what study means for society. What is the impact of this study? </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Submit your work </h2>
        <p>When complete, submit your journal graphic organizer, news article comparison and summary paragraph. </p>
        <p>This is an assessment for feedback, but not marks. Feedback and suggestions for improvement will be provided by the teacher using the following success criteria.</p>
