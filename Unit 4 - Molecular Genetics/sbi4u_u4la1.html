                    <p>In the early 1950s, the race to discover the chemical structure of the heredity molecule, DNA,
                        was intense. Only a few years earlier, it had been demonstrated that DNA carries genetic
                        information. The story of the discovery of DNA demonstrates the process of science, revealing
                        how science works by building on the earlier work of others, the excitement of discovery, and
                        the role that chance plays in the process.</p>

                        events in the discovery of DNA. This timeline should go into your notes so that you can use it
                        to study for assessments in this course. </p>
                    <p>To help guide your research, focus on big discoveries that were made in the years: 1869, 1919,
                        1928, 1944 and 1950-53. </p>
                    <p>Once you have reviewed the overview of the discovery of DNA, create a timeline with notes about

                        the details of its chemical structure, so you will focus on that in the rest of this section.

                        phosphate always joins at the 3’ end of the sugar as nucleotides are added, this means that the

                    <p>Now we'll cover more about the structure of DNA. The image here shows a short section of a piece
                        of DNA in its natural double helix or “twisted ladder” configuration</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Each nucleotide will quickly attract its complementary nucleotide to form a base pair, DNA
                            will not remain as a single strand, under normal conditions.</li>
                        <li>DNA usually consists of two strands, each a complement of the other, with one having the 5’
                            end at the top, and the other having the 3’ end at the top. Therefore, each strand is read
                            in an opposite direction.</li>
                        <li>The reason why paired DNA strands twist into a spiral or double helix shape is because of
                            the bond angles between the phosphate and sugar, as well as between the nucleotides. By
                            twisting into this shape, the molecule achieves its most stable configuration. </li>
                        <li>The amount of coiling will depend on chemical conditions and temperature, but under normal
                            conditions, the helix makes one complete turn about every 10 nucleotides. This means that
                            each full helical twist is about 3.4 nm long. </li>

                    <p>DNA extraction is an important laboratory technique that allows scientists to isolate DNA to
                        study its structure, properties and sequence. The process of isolating the DNA from the tissue
                        is called <strong>DNA extraction.</strong> </p>

                                    After completing this lab, you will have a sample of pure strawberry DNA that you
                                    can hold in your hand.</p>

                                <p>Ripe strawberries are used because they contain enzymes (pectinases and cellulases)
                                    that help to break down the cell walls, making it easier for you to extract the DNA.
                                </p>
                                <p>From the video, you saw that the museum scientists extracted DNA using a process that
                                    included heating and cooling. This ensures that the sample is as undamaged and pure
                                    as possible. However, here you are only concerned with extracting DNA for visual
                                    observation, so it does not have to be of high purity, which is why this simpler
                                    procedure does not require heating and cooling.</p>

                                        hour to ensure that it is cold. If you do not have access to a freezer, put the

                                <p>You will extract the DNA using a four-stage process, with each stage involving
                                    several steps. In the first stage, you will break open the cells of the ripe
                                    strawberry by crushing it. Second, you will use a lysis solution to break down the
                                    cellular and nuclear membranes to separate the DNA from the other cell parts. Third,
                                    you will filter out the solid material using a coffee filter or a thick piece of
                                    paper towel and collect the liquid containing the DNA. In the fourth and final
                                    stage, you will precipitate the DNA from the solution using very cold alcohol.</p>

                                    <li>Prepare the lysis solution: In a measuring cup, dissolve the salt in about 50mL
                                        of water. Add the 10mL of dishwashing liquid and then add the remaining water to
                                        make 100mL of solution. Gently stir but do not shake; you do not want a lot of
                                        bubbles.</li>
                                    <li>Obtain a ripe strawberry. If the green leaves (sepals) are still on the
                                        strawberry, remove them.</li>
                                    <li>Place the strawberry in the resealable plastic bag. Press the air out and seal
                                        it.</li>
                                    <li>Gently mash the bagged strawberry with your fingers for five minutes. Don’t
                                        break the bag.</li>
                                    <li>Add 10mL of lysis solution to the bag. Press the air out carefully and reseal
                                        the bag.</li>
                                    <li>Mash the bagged strawberry with the lysis solution for two minutes. This will
                                        separate out the DNA from the other cell parts.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Important</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>Mash the strawberry and
                                    lysis mixture carefully to avoid creating bubbles. The fewer bubbles you create, the
                                    better your results will be.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Prepare your filter apparatus. If you have a sieve and a small bowl, place the
                                        sieve across the bowl mouth so that any liquid can drip through the sieve and be
                                        caught in the bowl below. Lay the coffee filter paper or piece of paper towel
                                        onto the sieve screen. If you do not have a sieve handy, you can just use a
                                        coffee cup and place the coffee filter or paper towel over the top of the cup,
                                        but you may have to hold onto it as you start pouring.</li>
                                    <li>Cut one of the bottom corners off the bag and squeeze the strawberry pulp, along
                                        with the liquid, onto the coffee filter or paper towel.</li>
                                    <li>After the pulp mixture has been filtering for about a minute or two, pour
                                        approximately 10mL of water over the pulp on the filter. This rinsing will
                                        ensure that you obtain as much DNA as possible.</li>
                                    <li>Once the filtering appears complete, dispose of the bag, filter, and strawberry
                                        pulp into appropriate waste containers. Do not eat the mashed strawberry mixture
                                        as it contains dishwashing liquid.</li>
                                    <li>Pour the filtrate into a small, clear drinking glass.</li>
                                    <li>Raise the glass to eye level so that you can see what is happening and <em
                                            class="Italic">slowly </em>drizzle the <em class="Italic">ice-cold</em>
                                        isopropyl alcohol <em class="Italic">along the inside of the glass </em>until
                                        DNA strands begin to appear in the solution. Do this carefully as you do not
                                        want the alcohol to mix with the filtrate. The appearance of DNA is called
                                        precipitation.</li>
                                    <li>Observe the characteristics of the DNA as it precipitates.</li>
                                    <li>Once it appears that no more DNA is going to precipitate out, you can begin to
                                        collect the DNA on the plastic stir stick. Insert the stir stick into the
                                        mixture and slowly wind it around. You will notice that strands of material are
                                        wrapping themselves around the stick. Pull out the stir stick and observe. Those
                                        strands are the strawberry’s DNA.</li>
                                    <li>When finished, dispose of the materials safely. Pour the contents of the glass
                                        down the drain, along with running water. Do not drink any of the contents as
                                        they contain isopropyl alcohol, which is mildly poisonous.</li>

                    <p>Revisit your model DNA from the beginning of the learning activity if you built one. Now that you
                        know more about DNA is there any way that you could improve it, or make it more realistic? Can
                        you identify and label all the parts of the molecule now? </p>
                    <h3>Part 3: Reflection </h3>
                    <p>Now that you have completed this learning activity, reflect back on the success criteria. </p>
                    <ul>

                            understanding of DNA</li>
                        <li>Compare the structures of the four nitrogenous bases </li>
                        <li>Draw a representation or make a model to explain the structure of DNA</li>
                        <li>Identify (number) the carbons on a sugar molecule and explain the meaning of 5’ and 3’ </li>
                        <li>Extract DNA from plants/food or describe the process </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Looking at your notes for this learning activity, are they complete? Do you have all the
                        information you will need to study later on? Take the time to review concepts you are unsure
                        about before moving on. </p>
                    <p>Select your level of readiness for each criterion. </p>
