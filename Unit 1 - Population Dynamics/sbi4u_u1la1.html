                    <p>Welcome to Grade 12 Biology. You will begin your exploration of biology by studying human populations.</p>
                    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. Humans have taken the center stage in this journey as life on earth has evolved.</p>
                    <p>The human population has grown exponentially over the years. Before we begin our look at the human population, do you know how many humans live on Earth at this moment? </p>
                    <p>Wondering how close you were? </p>
                    <p>Perform a quick internet search of the current world population from a reliable source.</p>

                            <p>You will need a notebook for this course. You may choose to use a paper notebook and handwrite your notes. Or, you may choose to create a document on your computer using Microsoft Word, Office 365, Google Drive or some other file storing
                                network. Consider carefully which works best for you. You should summarize new learning and add notes to the notebook at the end of each learning activity. It is important for learners to actively think and make connections when learning
                                new content. This active thinking, note-taking and brainstorming while reading greatly increases success and comprehension.</p>
                            <p>It’s important to note that throughout this course you will be asked to brainstorm ideas and make rough notes as part of the learning process.</p>

                        amount of food available will continually act to limit human population size.</p>

                    <p>In the early 1900s, most developed countries began to experience significant changes in their social structure. </p>
                    <p>A reduction in family size was seen due to:</p>

                        <li>low risk of infant mortality</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As people moved away from farms into the cities, they did not need to have as many children for labour. Also, living space in cities was smaller, so it was more expensive to house a large family</p>
                    <p>As a result, populations in many developed countries entered stage 3, as shown in the graph. Their population size was still increasing, but the rate of this increase was slowing down. </p>

                    <p>Estimates vary widely but most studies agree that the rate of global population growth is slowing down significantly. For example, in 2007, the United Nations Population Division projected that the world’s population will likely surpass
                        10 billion in 2055 and then begin to decline because of economic factors, health concerns, land exhaustion, and environmental hazards.</p>

                            <p>Why do humans over-consume so many natural resources, even when they know the environmental consequences? </p>
                            <p>One reason is known as the “tragedy of the commons.” The phrase comes from an example about cattle grazing, written in 1968 by Garrett Hardin, an ecologist. (You saw one of his quotes earlier in the lesson.)</p>

                <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1">
                    <p>A “commons” is a shared field for grazing cattle that is open to everyone. Because the land is not owned or controlled by anyone, there is no reason to help conserve the grass. If you try to conserve the grass by grazing fewer cattle,
                        your competitor will use the resource that you saved in order to graze more cattle for himself and make money at your expense. So, it does not pay any of the cattle ranchers to try and conserve the grass. The resource is doomed to be
                        over-exploited until it is gone. Everyone knows they are destroying the resource, but they feel they have no choice. That is why it is a called a tragedy.</p>

                            <p>The tragedy of the commons appears in many shared resources, especially in the ocean fisheries. Because no one owns the fish, no one benefits from conserving them. If you don’t catch as many fish as you can, then someone else will.
                                You will study a dramatic example of this in a case study of the Atlantic cod, in a later lesson.</p>

                    <p>Canada is helping developing nations deal with their problems mainly in two ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>social and economic development</li>
                        <li>advances in biotechnology that can help feed a hungry world</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Canadian social and economic aid</h3>
                    <p>Currently, Canada delivers much of its aid to developing countries through:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The federal government ministry</li>
                        <li>Foreign Affairs</li>
                        <li>Trade</li>
                        <li>Development Canada</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Formerly, it was done through the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). Canada provides funding and expertise in partnership with local governments and other development agencies. It is helping hundreds of millions of people
                        in many countries around the world. Projects tend to focus on the ability of the nation to help itself, through economic and social development.</p>
                    <h3>Task: Canadian initiatives in the developing world</h3>
                    <p>Canada’s Global Affairs Department is responsible for distributing foreign aid. There are many types of foreign aid that may range from economic funding, resource allocation, or other types of support. To find out more about the various
                        projects, go to <a href="http://w05.international.gc.ca/projectbrowser-banqueprojets/?lang=eng&amp;_ga=2.245925382.388452958.1547669127-1757234055.1547669127" target="_blank">the department’s website<span class="sr-only">(Opens in new
                                window)</span></a>.</p>
                    <p>Your task is to find one project and learn more about the partnership with the developing country and the impact of the initiative.</p>

                    <p><strong>Task: Research the population growth trends of another country</strong></p>
                    <p>As you have seen in this learning activity, different populations around the globe are experiencing different growth rates, some being a positive rate (increase in population) and others with a negative rate (decrease in population). We
                        may seem to understand the factors involved in growth of various populations, but we should rely on evidence from research to infer the reasons behind these trends.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Research one (1) example for each type of growth rate (positive and negative).</li>
                        <li>Be sure to choose a reputable, unbiased and accurate Internet source. This information should be relatively recent as well (e.g. within the last two (2) years).</li>
