                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>In the Minds On activity you considered the impact of introducing a non-native species into a new
                        habitat. The invasive Carp is an example of a non-native species that made their way into a new
                        habitat - the waters of the Great Lakes.
                        These organisms are expanding out of control, sometimes with devastating consequences. </p>
                    <p>Other non-native species, like zebra mussels that have invaded the Great Lakes, or the Japanese
                        beetle that is rapidly destroying trees throughout western Canada have had populations increase
                        rapidly over the last decade. </p>
                    <p>You also hear about species whose populations are so low they are threatened with extinction,
                        like the giant panda. </p>
                    <p>In both cases, it is important for us to understand the factors that make these populations
                        behave in the way they do, in order for us to help manage them.</p>

                    <h3>Population dynamics</h3>
                    <p>Population dynamics are the changes in population size that occur over time.</p>
                    <p>The four factors that affect population dynamics are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>births</li>
                        <li>deaths</li>
                        <li>immigration</li>
                        <li>emigration</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Population dynamics are the result of an interaction between:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>internal factors</strong> (for example, reproductive ability) </li>
                        <li><strong>external factors</strong> (for example, weather, food supply, predation, and
                            disease)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Some populations remain relatively stable over long periods of time, while others may fluctuate
                        dramatically or go through cycles. Population dynamics research studies how the internal and
                        external factors affecting population size
                        interact to produce changes in population size. This can get very complicated, since populations
                        are simultaneously affected by density, the amount of resources available, their environment,
                        and interactions with other species. </p>

                    <h3>Modelling and predicting population change</h3>
                    <p>As you learned in the previous learning activity, human activities impact all species on the
                        planet. </p>
                    <p>This forces us to become global resource managers. However, to do so, we need to know how
                        populations respond to combinations of factors influencing their dynamics. We also need to be
                        able to predict how populations will act in response
                        to the actions we take. </p>
                    <p>For this purpose, biologists create models of population dynamics to see how populations respond
                        to changes in various input factors.</p>
                    <p>Before you can predict how a population will change, you need to create a model of how its
                        population dynamics work. Models are made up of equations that describe how the population
                        responds to changes in internal and external factors.
                        Models of population growth range from the simple to the complex. They are built starting with
                        the simplest set of factors thought to be necessary. If the simple model fails to produce
                        accurate predictions, then more factors are added,
                        which makes the model more complex. </p>

                                    <p>Geometric growth is the simplest population growth model.</p>
                                    <p>1. It happens in populations where individuals can only breed once per time
                                        period (like deer, which breed once per year).</p>
                                    <p>2. If the birth and death rates per individual remain constant, then the
                                        population growth rate is constant over a fixed time period (for example, one
                                        year).</p>
                                    <p>For example, in the colony of bacteria shown in the table below, the population
                                        is doubling every day. Day 0 is the day from which the initial population size
                                        is measured. On Day 0, the population size is 1. On the next day, it
                                        doubles to 2 and the day after that, it becomes 4, and so on.</p>

                                        some point, the population runs out of resources like food or space. All
                                        populations eventually face limits on their growth. When this happens, the
                                        growth curve changes shape. The logistic growth model describes this pattern.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The logistic growth model more closely resembles what happens in natural
                                        populations. Most populations begin with only a handful of breeding individuals.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Since the population is small, the amount of available resources in the area may
                                        be much greater than the population needs. So, initially, population growth will
                                        not be limited by the resources available. This leads to
                                        geometric or exponential growth. </p>

                                    <p>At some point, the population increase begins to slow down because the supply of
                                        available resources becomes limited, until eventually, the size stabilizes near
                                        its carrying capacity. Because the resulting curve on the graph
                                        looks S-shaped, it is sometimes also called a sigmoid curve (sigma is the Greek
                                        letter, S).</p>

                                    <p>As shown in the following figure, the logistic population growth model can be
                                        divided into three phases: </p>

                                    <p><strong>N</strong> is the population size at time <em class="Italic">t</em></p>
                                    <p><strong>r</strong> is the growth rate per individual</p>
                                    <p><strong>K</strong> is the carrying capacity</p>

                                    <p>This equation is similar to the one you saw previously for exponential growth.
                                        The difference here is the addition of the term (K &#x2013; N)/K. This term
                                        gives you the proportion of the carrying capacity that is still
                                        unused. As N gets closer in value to K, (K &#x2013; N)/K gets closer to zero.
                                        This causes the population growth rate to slow down (late log phase). When N
                                        reaches K, this term is zero, and so population growth stops
                                        (stationary phase).</p>

                                    <p>The logistic growth model is useful for modelling the behaviour of natural
                                        populations, because it accounts for the fact that resources are always finite.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>However, it assumes that the amount of resources stays constant. In natural
                                        systems, there are often variations in resource availability. </p>
                                    <p>For example, the amount of space and food available may be reduced by the arrival
                                        of a new species that competes for these resources. Abiotic factors, like
                                        extreme weather, fire, or floods can also change the amount of
                                        resources available. </p>
                                    <p>As a result, natural populations generally display logistic growth patterns, but
                                        not as cleanly as shown in the theoretical model seen in the previous figure.

                                    <h4>Examples of density-dependent factors</h4>
                                    <p>Density-dependent factors include:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Predator focus<br>Predators may focus their hunting on the most common prey,
                                            because they are so visible. As prey density goes up, predation pressure may
                                            increase, causing higher mortality.</li>
                                        <li>Resource availability<br>When density is high, individuals have to share
                                            resources. In some cases, this increases the amount of energy they spend
                                            acquiring and protecting resources(for example, feeding territories),which
                                            leads
                                            to lower birth rates and higher mortality rates.</li>
                                        <li>Aggression<br>Under high density some species, like mice, change their
                                            behaviour and become more anti-social and aggressive against their own
                                            species.</li>
                                        <li>Emigration<br>As density increases, some individuals may migrate away from
                                            the area, seeking better conditions and thus decreasing the population size.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Waste accumulation<br>In dense populations, there can be an accumulation of
                                            toxic wastes, such as fecal matter and urine, which pollute the habitat.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Disease<br>Diseases and parasites can often spread more quickly in densely
                                            crowded populations.</li>
                                        <li>Stress<br>High density increases stress levels in many animals, leading to
                                            weakened immune systems and other health problems.</li>

                                        class="img-responsive">
                                    <p>There is dramatic evidence of this in populations of the Japanese beetles
                                        (<i>Popillia japonica</i>) in western Canada.</p>
                                    <p>The Japanese beetle has traditionally not been very abundant in Canada. However,
                                        with climate change, it is spreading northwards, through British Columbia, and
                                        east into Alberta, as the climate warms up. The beetles lay
                                        their eggs in pine trees and when the eggs hatch, the larvae eat the tissue
                                        under the bark, eventually causing the trees to die. Huge areas of western
                                        Canada are becoming deforested, due to the recent increase in pine beetle
                                        populations.</p>
                                    <p>Cold winters used to kill off most of the Japanese beetles every year, keeping
                                        their numbers low. As winters become milder, the beetles are surviving better,
                                        which is resulting in an explosion in their numbers. This is an example of
                                        a density-independent factor because the warm weather benefits all beetles,
                                        whether their population size is high or low.</p>

                    <h4>The data</h4>
                    <p>During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, employees of the Hudson&#x2019;s Bay Company in
                        northern Ontario reported that the Ojibwe First Nations people would go through periods of
                        starvation approximately every 10 years. They
                        attributed this to the very obvious periodic decline in a major food source of these indigenous
                        people: the snowshoe hare.</p>
                    <p>At that time, both the hare and its main predator, the lynx, were trapped for their fur, which
                        was sold commercially through the Hudson&#x2019;s Bay Company. Because of this, the
                        Hudson&#x2019;s Bay Company kept detailed records of the
                        numbers of pelts (skins with fur) collected every year, over a period of several hundred years.
                        These records revealed a cycling of the population sizes of lynx and hares, with each cycle
                        lasting about 10 years. A sample of this data is
                        shown below:</p>
                    <figure><img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_01.04.23.png"
                        alt="Number of pelts of the Canadian lynx (dotted line) and snowshoe hare (solid line) collected by the Hudson’s Bay Company between 1845 and 1935.  Graphs demonstrates that the two populations follow the same trend as their populations increase and decrease."
                        class="img-responsive"></figure>
                    <p>You can see that the numbers of hare are generally higher than the numbers of lynx, but that both
                        reach peak levels about every 10 years, and then dramatically drop off again. You can also see
                        that the population peaks in lynx seem to
                        occur a year or two later than those for the hares. In the 1950s, biologists analyzed these
                        records to try and understand what caused these regular cycles. The idea that populations cycled
                        naturally was considered unlikely, as the
                        scientific consensus at the time was that natural
                        populations were generally stable. This data set has since become a textbook example of natural
                        population cycling, and the research into why it occurs continues to this day.</p>

                        hares eat all of the available needles in a short
                        time. Lynx are major predators of the hares and will travel many kilometres to find areas in

                                    <p>This causes the population of lynx to drop dramatically as well, but this only
                                        occurs after the hares have begun their decline. With low numbers of hares, the
                                        vegetation now begins its recovery. Eventually, with more food
                                        available and lower numbers of predators, the hare population increases, and the

                        <p>The population increase in the lynx takes about a year to occur after the hare population
                            increases, because the lynx only gives birth once per year in spring. As the abundance of
                            hares declines, there is less food for the lynx, but
                            this does not cause starvation or a decline in the lynx population until most of the hares
                            are gone, and this takes many months to occur.</p>
