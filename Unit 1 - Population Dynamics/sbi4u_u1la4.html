        <p>We are learning to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>explain the concepts of interaction (e.g., competition, predation, defence mechanism, symbiotic
                relationship, parasitic relationship) between different species</li>
            <li>explain factors such as carrying capacity, fecundity, density, and predation that cause fluctuation in
                populations, and analyse the fluctuation in the population of a species of plant, wild animal, or
                microorganism</li>

                    <p>Species don’t exist in isolation. Their populations interact directly and indirectly with the
                        other species around them. Understanding these interactions is the key to managing our natural
                        resources and saving the earth’s diminishing
                        biodiversity. Biologists are in a race against time to get this knowledge.</p>
                    <p>In the last learning activity, you saw how a direct interaction—predation—could drive population
                        dynamics. In this learning activity, you will learn about two more types of important direct
                        interaction: competition and symbiosis.</p>

                    <p>Species also interact indirectly with each other in a web of life so complex that we are only
                        beginning to understand it. A change in one population can affect the entire hierarchy of living
                        things in that system, often in surprising ways. A case study on the decline of the Atlantic cod
                        fishery dramatically reveals how humans can upset the natural ecosystem hierarchy with dramatic
                        and unforeseen consequences.</p>
                    <p>Just like the fibres in this cobweb are connected and are directly or indirectly interacting with
                        each other, species also interact directly or indirectly in the complex web of life.</p>

                    <h2>Levels of organization in ecological systems</h2>
                    <p><strong>Populations</strong> of species interact with each other and also with individuals from
                        other species who live in the same habitat. The combined interactions of species together in an
                        area form <strong>communities</strong>. The
                        boundaries of communities are sometimes hard to define. Communities can be as small as a patch
                        of soil or as large as a hundred square kilometres of boreal forest, depending on the type of
                        interactions you are studying. Groups of
                        communities interact together to form <strong>ecosystems</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Ecologists recognize a hierarchy of organizational levels to describe how individuals and species
                        interact within an area.</p>

                        <li><strong>Populations</strong> are formed at the next level when individuals of the same

                    <h2>Habitat</h2>
                    <p>Ecologists define “<strong>habitat</strong>” as the space in which individuals of a species carry
                        out their daily lives. While many species may occupy the same habitat, each species uses
                        slightly different aspects of it to ensure their
                        survival. How an organism uses its habitat, and the way it utilizes the resources within it, is
                        called its ecological “<strong>niche</strong>.”</p>

                                    <p><strong>Exploitative competition</strong> is indirect competition (for example,
                                        when one organism eats all of the fruit off a tree a day before another organism
                                        can arrive to feed on it). Each organism is exploiting the
                                        resource that
                                        could be used by the other, even if they are never in the same place at the same

                    <p>Theoretically, if there are not enough resources to support all of the competing species, then
                        the populations of the less successful ones will decline. Even the successful species are not
                        expected to reach their potential maximum
                        population growth rate for a while, because they aren’t getting all of the resources for
                        themselves. But how important is interspecific competition in nature? </p>
                    <p>This question was answered in a landmark study on barnacles living on rocks by the seashore. It
                        provided the first strong evidence of the importance of interspecific competition in shaping
                        community structure.</p>

                                    <p>Dr. J.H. Connell, a researcher at the University of California, conducted a study
                                        of the interaction between two species of barnacle that inhabit the coast of
                                        Scotland. Barnacles are sedentary filter feeders that permanently attach
                                        to
                                        a rock for life. They vary in size and shape, and have different adaptations
                                        that make them suited to different habitats within the marine environment.</p>

                                            barnacles lived on rocks that were underwater at high tide but exposed to
                                            the air at low tide. </li>
                                        <li><em>Chthamalus</em> spent part of their day exposed to the dry air of the
                                            atmosphere, so they adapted physically and behaviourally, to avoid becoming
                                            dried out when the tide was low. </li>

                                        were always submerged. They adapted so that they would succeed in the underwater

                                    <p>Most species are restricted to existing in just their realized niche, because of
                                        the actions of the other species with which they share the habitat. This causes
                                        a lot of the variation in community patterns that are seen in nature.

In the first graph labelled 'In separate containers', P. aurelia is higher than P. caudatum by a small margin by day 16. In the second graph labelled In one container, P.caudatums relative population density is reaching 0 by day 16, and P. aurelias relative population density is very high in comparison.

                                    <p>Gause concluded that when resources are limited and two species share similar
                                        requirements, they can’t coexist in the same community. This became known as
                                        <strong>Gause’s principle of competitive exclusion.</strong> The result of
                                        competitive exclusion in nature is that it is very rare for two species with
                                        similar niche requirements to be in competition for very long. One will
                                        eventually out-compete the other, resulting in the disappearance of the loser.

                    <p><strong>How can species coexist?</strong></p>
                    <p>Interspecific competition in a community should eventually result in the loss of one of the
                        competitors. So, why do we see similar species coexisting in nature?</p>
                    <p>The answer lies in how the species share the resources. Similar species that share the same area
                        usually divide up the resources using a method called <strong>resource partitioning</strong>.
                        This means that each species specializes in
                        harvesting one particular subset of the resource. </p>
                    <p>For example, on islands in the Caribbean, several species of lizard in the genus <em>Anolis</em>
                        can be found on the same tree. These lizards all eat a similar diet of insects, vegetation, or
                        fruit.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_01.05.18.jpg" alt="Anolis Lizard" class="img-right-50 img-responsive">
                    <p> How can so many species of lizard coexist on the same tree, when they apparently all use the
                        same resources?</p>
                    <p>Through careful observation, it was noticed that each <em>Anolis</em> species was associated with
                        certain parts of the tree. Some species preferred branches near the top, some perched on the
                        tips of branches lower down, and others clung to the
                        trunks. By splitting the niche the whole tree) into parts and specializing in using only their
                        part, the different <em>Anolis</em> lizards were able to share the tree without directly
                        competing for the same resources. This allowed several
                        species to coexist.</p>

                    <p>Predation is a major force shaping community structure. Like many interspecific interactions,
                        predation can cause changes in the community that reach beyond the individual species directly
                        involved.

                        class="img-right-50 img-responsive">
                    <p>Since predation is fatal to the prey species; there is strong selection pressure on the prey to
                        evolve ways to defend against predators. For example, individual hares that can outrun the lynx
                        will survive to breed and pass on those
                        speedy traits to their offspring. But running isn’t the only defense possible and a species may
                        incorporate several of the defense strategies described next, to maximize their chance of
                        survival.</p>
                    <p>Defending against predation is not restricted just to animals; plants can also be prey. For
                        example, every time a deer eats a young tree seedling, it is killing that tree. That is why
                        defences against predation are a big factor in the
                        evolution of plant diversity.</p>
                    <h3>Types of defenses</h3>
                    <p>Prey species have evolved many forms of defence against their predators. This is one of the
                        reasons why life on earth is so diverse. </p>
                    <p>Three of the main types of defence are described next: </p>

                                    <p>Animals and plants have evolved chemicals that they can use to reduce predation.

                                    <p>For example, skunks can spray a noxious-smelling chemical in self-defence—even at
                                        you, if they see you as a threat! Since plants can’t run away from their
                                        predators, they tend to rely on chemical defences the most.</p>
                                    <p>Many plants produce secondary chemical compounds to keep predators away. These
                                        chemicals are not essential to the plant’s metabolism, so they are considered
                                        secondary to the plant. These chemical compounds can range in
                                        severity, from those that are toxic and kill the predator, to those that
                                        interfere with its metabolism, to those that just leave a nasty taste in the
                                        predator’s mouth.</p>
                                    <p>For example, milkweed plants, found in fields throughout Ontario, are named for
                                        the sticky white sap they produce, which is a chemical that is unpalatable to
                                        most animals.</p>
                                    <p>Plants may seem to be a passive and unprotected organism, but there are so many
                                        different ways that plants can defend themselves. To learn about some of these
                                        mechanisms, you may read about all the different ways they can do

                                        of the food left behind, after the anemone has digested its prey. This
                                        relationship is commensal because, even though the clownfish gains protection,
                                        and even food, the anemone seems to gain no advantage or disadvantage from the

                                    <b>Social parasitism</b>
                                    <p>A different approach to parasitism is found in <strong>social
                                            parasitism</strong>. This does not involve a parasite consuming resources
                                        from its host’s body. Instead, the parasite manipulates the social behaviour of
                                        the host. A
                                        dramatic example of social parasitism is when a bird’s nest is taken over by
                                        another bird that uses the nest for its own eggs. This type of parasitism is
                                        called<strong> brood parasitism</strong>, because the parasitic bird
                                        manipulates the host bird into raising its own offspring or “brood.”</p>

                                    <p>A famous example of this type of parasitic bird found in Ontario is the common
                                        cuckoo <em>(Cuculus canorus). </em> The mother cuckoo watches other nesting
                                        birds until it detects that they have left their nest unattended. It
                                        then quickly flies over and lays its eggs in the nest, after throwing the host
                                        bird’s own eggs out of the nest. The cuckoo then quickly abandons the eggs. Upon
                                        their return, the host parents do not recognize the switch and
                                        incubate the cuckoo’s eggs as their own. When the young cuckoos hatch, the host
                                        parents feed the chicks. As a result, the host parents do the cuckoo parents’
                                        work for them.</p>

                    <h2>Community-level interactions</h2>
                    <p>There can be thousands of species in a habitat. All may be interacting with each other, to
                        varying degrees, through predation, competition, or symbiotic relationships. How can you make
                        sense of this complexity? </p>
                    <p>Ecologists organize these interactions in two ways, to help them understand patterns in natural
                        communities. </p>
                    <p>1. First, species are grouped into energy-flow hierarchies based on what they eat. These feeding
                        hierarchies are called <strong>trophic levels.</strong></p>
                    <p>2. Second, the connections among species in a community are analyzed as networks. These networks
                        are called <strong>food webs.</strong></p>
                    <h3>Food webs</h3>
                    <p>The linear feeding relationships through the trophic levels are sometimes called <strong>food
                            chains. </strong>In real communities, most chains are cross-linked to other food chains, to
                        form complex networks of feeding relationships
                        called <strong>food webs</strong>. It is through these networks that changes in the population
                        dynamics of one species can have a ripple effect on many other species in the community.</p>
                    <p>A simplified food web of a typical small lake in Ontario is shown in the following figure. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Green plants like algae, pond lilies, and reeds are the producers. </li>
                        <li>They are eaten by herbivorous fish, insect larvae, and crayfish, which are the main primary
                            consumers.</li>
                        <li>Secondary consumers, like leopard frogs, carnivorous fish (for example, bass), and insects
                            (for example, water beetles) eat the herbivores. </li>
                        <li>Finally, tertiary consumers, such as predatory birds (for example, the blue heron) eat the
                            primary consumers (for example, crayfish), as well as the secondary consumers (for example,
                            leopard frogs and bass).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>You can follow the flow of energy through individual food chains within this food web to see how
                        the feeding relationships might affect the population dynamics of each species.</p>
                    <p>For example, one chain is:</p>
                    <p><strong>Algae &rarr; insect larvae &rarr; leopard frogs &rarr; bass &rarr; blue heron</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>while a second is:</p>
                    <p><strong>Pond lily &rarr; crayfish &rarr; bass &rarr; blue heron</strong></p>
                    <p>Both chains begin with the photosynthetic capture of sunlight energy and end with the consumption
                        of bass by blue herons. The second chain has fewer levels (four versus five). Because the second
                        chain is fewer steps away from the
                        original energy source (i.e. the sun), it is more efficient at transferring the sun’s energy.
                        You can see that the trophic levels for the bass and blue heron change, depending on which chain
                        you use.</p>

                    <p>When the abundance of a species changes, for whatever reason, it can cause a shift in the energy
                        flow throughout the ecosystem. These changes can then affect the populations of the other
                        species in the food web, either directly or
                        indirectly. To see how this can happen, imagine what would happen in the Ontario lake’s food
                        web, if the frogs were to suddenly disappear.</p>

                            <li>the populations of insect larvae they feed on would increase, since they would be under
                                less
                                predation pressure. </li>
                            <li>the bass would be without a major food source. Either its population would decline or
                                the
                                bass would have to shift to eating more of the other prey species, such as crayfish,
                                herbivorous fish, or water beetles. If the bass shifted
                                their diet, then those prey species would probably suffer population declines.</li>
                            <li>the situation for the water beetles and algae is unclear. </li>
                            <li>the beetles would get to eat more insect larvae, but the bass might prey upon them more.
                            </li>
                            <li>the abundance of algae would probably decrease, because there would be more insect

                                feed on it unless the number of water beetles became very high, in which case the algae
                                could become even more abundant. </li>

                        class="img-right-50 img-responsive">
                    <p>Atlantic cod <em>(Gadus morhua)</em> normally live near the bottom of the ocean, along the
                        continental shelves surrounding the North Atlantic Ocean. They can live to be over 20 years old.
                        Adults are usually about a metre long and weigh about five kilograms, but some can grow to be
                        over
                        two metres long and weigh over 100 kilograms. Atlantic cod are a top predator in the food chain,
                        feeding on smaller fish,
                        shrimp, and crab.</p>
                    <p>In 1497, English explorer John Cabot reached the North Atlantic fishing grounds southeast of
                        Newfoundland, in an area now called the Grand Banks. Cabot reported that the cod fish were so
                        abundant there, that his crew could just drop
                        baskets over the side of the ship to haul in all the fish they could eat. Over the next 450
                        years, the cod were fished sustainably. This stopped in 1992, when the Government of Canada was
                        forced to close the Grand Banks cod fishery
                        because there were no fish left.</p>
                    <p>The story of the cod fishery collapse has become a famous example of how human overconsumption
                        and the tragedy of the commons can destroy even the most abundant resource. It also reveals the
                        complexity of food webs and how changes in
                        one species can cause unpredictable consequences for the entire ecosystem. How could such an
                        abundant population of fish be wiped out and what were the consequences for the ecosystem?</p>
                    <p><b>Why the fishery collapsed?</b></p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_01.05.39.jpg" alt="Large factory freezer ship"
                        class="img-left-50 img-responsive">
                    <p>The fishery changed dramatically in 1951, with the arrival of the first factory freezer ship.
                        These new ships combined the roles of a fish processing plant and a fishing boat. Because they
                        could be used to process and freeze their
                        catch at sea, they could be taken out for weeks at a time, catching fish continuously. They were
                        also equipped with sonar that was designed to find large schools of fish.</p>
                    <p>These ships were called “bottom trawlers” because they trawled (dragged) huge nets along the
                        ocean floor. The nets scooped up everything in their path, while scraping the seabed. This
                        destroyed the feeding and spawning grounds of fish
                        like cod. The nets strip-mined the ocean floor’s ecosystem. By the mid-1960s, there were
                        hundreds of these ships, from various countries, on the Grand Banks.</p>
                    <p>Annual catches of cod and other large predatory fish rose dramatically. In 1968, the cod catch
                        peaked at 810 000 tonnes, four times greater than the previous average annual catch. The factory
                        ships were so effective at unsustainably catching cod that it took them only
                        <strong>15 years</strong> to catch as much cod as had been caught in the previous 300 years
                        combined, and thousands of years before that when Indigenous peoples fished sustainably.

                        alt="Historical record of the Atlantic cod fishery’s annual catches in tonnes, since 1850. Notice how it took only 24 years for the industry to collapse from the time of its peak."
                        class="img-responsive">
                    <p>The high fishing pressure caused the numbers of cod to decline rapidly, during the 1970s. The
                        Canadian government responded by lowering the quota on the number of cod that could be caught
                        within its territorial waters, but this effort
                        was too little and too late. In 1992, the fishery was closed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ecosystem consequences</strong></p>
                    <p>Everyone assumed that once the cod were protected from fishing, their numbers would increase
                        again, probably exponentially. This hasn’t happened yet, and recent research suggests it may not
                        happen at all, because of permanent changes
                        to the food web. You can see how this happens by examining a simplified food chain for the cod.
                    </p>
                    <p>Simplified cod food chain:</p>
                    <p><strong>Phytoplankton (producers) → zooplankton → small fish, shrimp, crabs → cod</strong></p>
                    <p>Once the cod, and other large predatory fish, disappeared due to overfishing, their prey
                        experienced a population explosion. This was expected, based on the food chain relationship. The
                        top predators in the ecosystem are now the small
                        fish, shrimp, and crabs.</p>
                    <p>One unforeseen development is that the small fish predators also compete with, and eat, the very
                        young cod. This means that cod are more likely to be the prey of the small fish, than to be
                        their predators. The cod population can’t
                        increase because competition with, and predation by, the small fish prevents most cod from
                        growing large enough to become the top predator in the web. Before the collapse, there were
                        enough large cod to keep the numbers of small fish
                        low, which gave the young cod a chance to grow up. This isn’t the case anymore.</p>
                    <p>This discovery shows how complex the relationships in food webs can be, and the challenges that
                        exist in making predictions about the dynamics of populations in the real world.</p>
