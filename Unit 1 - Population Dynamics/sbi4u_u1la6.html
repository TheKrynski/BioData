        <h1>Assessment for feedback</h1>
        <h2>Final project: Part A</h2>
        <p>At the end of the last unit of this course you will submit a final project related to primary and secondary
          sources for grading. Throughout the course you will have the opportunity to build knowledge and skills related
          to the final project
          and submit work for feedback but not a grade to help you prepare for the final project. At this point you will
          complete the first part of your final project. You will submit this for feedback.</p>
        <p>We read, watch and listen to media about science and research all the time. These pieces of media are always
          stating “in a recent study….”, “a study found that….”, or similar statements. Those original studies are
          considered primary
          sources of information because they are the original published research about that study. In this activity you
          will compare primary and secondary research and scholarly (also called peer-reviewed or refereed) and
          non-scholarly
          sources.</p>
        <h3>Step 1: </h3>
        <p>Research the differences between primary and secondary sources, to answer the question below. One place you
          may want to start is the following website comparing primary and secondary sources - <a
            href="https://umb.libguides.com/PrimarySources/secondary"
            target="_blank">https://umb.libguides.com/PrimarySources/secondary<span class="sr-only"> (Opens in new
              window)</span></a></p>
        <p>In your own words, state the difference between primary and secondary sources.</p>
        <button class="btn btn-default btn-answer-reveal" id="sbi4u_u1la7-suggestedAnswerButton-1">Suggested
          Answer</button>
        <div class="answer_reveal invisible" id="sbi4u_u1la7-suggestedAnswer-1">
          <p>Primary sources are the original piece of information. Secondary sources are reporting, critiquing or
            responding to that original primary source. They may quote or cite the original primary source, but are
            talking “about it”.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Complete the following table brainstorming a list of possible primary and secondary sources in your notebook.
          Review the suggested answers after you have brainstormed.</p>
        <table class="table table-bordered">
          <thead></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><b class="Body-Bold">Primary Sources</b></td>
              <td><b class="Body-Bold">Secondary Sources</b></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><button class="btn btn-default btn-answer-reveal" id="sbi4u_u1la7-suggestedAnswerButton-2">Suggested
                  Answer</button>
                <div class="answer_reveal invisible" id="sbi4u_u1la7-suggestedAnswer-2">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Original artwork</li>
                    <li>Peer-reviewed journal article (the original research)</li>
                    <li>Interviews</li>
                    <li>Book (if sharing original work or research)</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
              </td>
              <td><button class="btn btn-default btn-answer-reveal" id="sbi4u_u1la7-suggestedAnswerButton-3">Suggested
                  Answer</button>
                <div class="answer_reveal invisible" id="sbi4u_u1la7-suggestedAnswer-3">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Article critiquing art</li>
                    <li>Article summarizing or sharing research study </li>
                    <li>Textbooks sharing research or information</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Notice that some media forms (ex. books) are in both columns, however they are classified based on what type
          of information they contain.</p>
        <h3>Step 2: </h3>
        <p>Next, perform research and make notes on how to identify scholarly sources compared to non-scholarly sources.
          One place you may want to start you research is this website: <a
            href="http://guides.library.cornell.edu/c.php?g=31867&amp;p=201758"
            target="_blank">http://guides.library.cornell.edu/c.php?g=31867&amp;p=201758<span class="sr-only"> (Opens in
              new window)</span></a></p>
        <p>Using your notes on scholarly and non-scholarly sources, complete the following Venn diagram comparing the
          two types of sources. You will submit this to the teacher for feedback.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_01.07.01.svg" alt="Venn Diagram" class="img-responsive">
        <h3>Step 3: </h3>
        <p>Perform research on “Fake News” and how to identify it. From your research create a list of tips for students
          like yourself to help you identify and avoid Fake News. You will submit this for feedback. You may want to
          start your research at
          the
          following website <a href="http://guides.library.cornell.edu/evaluate_news"
            target="_blank">http://guides.library.cornell.edu/evaluate_news<span class="sr-only"> (Opens in new
              window)</span></a>.</p>
        <h3>Step 4: </h3>
        <p>Perform research to find at least two articles on the following topic: “The effects of climate change on
          polar bear populations”. You must find one article based on primary research and one based on secondary
          research. After reviewing the
          articles, recreate and complete the table below which you will submit for feedback.</p>
        <table class="table table-bordered">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <td></td>

        </table>
        <h3>Step 5: </h3>
        <p>Write a 1-paragraph summary of the comparison. Which one is the primary source? How are primary and secondary
          sources different from each other? Similar to each other? How can you tell which is which? You will submit
          this paragraph for
          feedback.</p>
