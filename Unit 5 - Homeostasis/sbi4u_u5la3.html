                    <p>The <strong>endocrine system</strong> is a system of glandular tissues that produce and secrete
                        special messenger molecules called hormones, into the blood. The word “hormone” means “to excite
                        or set into motion.” <strong>Hormones</strong> are often produced in one part of the body and
                        then travel in the blood to a target tissue cell, bind to it, and affect it in some way. The
                        image here shows the main parts of the human endocrine system in males and females.</p>

                    <h2>Types of Hormones: Steroid and Protein</h2>
                    <p>Hormones don’t affect all cells. Cells may have receptors for one hormone, but not for another.
                        For example, liver cells and muscle cells have many receptor sites for insulin, whereas less
                        active cells, like bone and cartilage cells, have fewer receptors for insulin.</p>
                    <p>There are two types of hormones that differ, both in chemical structure and action: steroid and
                        protein hormones.</p>
                    <h3>Steroid Hormones</h3>
                    <p>Steroid hormones are derivatives of cholesterol. The three types of steroid hormones and their
                        structure are illustrated below. They are composed of complex, fused rings of carbon, hydrogen,
                        and oxygen molecules. Steroid hormones are not soluble in water but are soluble in fat.</p>

                    <h4>The mechanism of action for protein hormones</h4>

                    <p>Proteins must work in a different way from steroid hormones as they cannot cross the phospholipid
                        bilayer easily. Some form a <strong>hormone-receptor complex</strong> that activates the
                        production of an enzyme called <strong>adenyl cyclase</strong>, which, in turn, causes the cell
                        to convert ATP into cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). The cyclic AMP functions as a
                        messenger, activating enzymes in the cytoplasm to carry out their normal functions.</p>
                    <h2>Pituitary Gland</h2>
                    <p>The pituitary gland is often called “the master gland,” because it exercises control over other
                        endocrine glands. It also produces and stores several hormones. It is a small sac-like structure
                        that is connected to the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland has two lobes: the posterior lobe and
                        the anterior lobe.</p>
                    <p>The pituitary gland is controlled by the hypothalamus, which is part of the brain and the nervous
                        system.</p> <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_05.03.10.png"

                    <p>Recall from an earlier learning activity, where you learned about antidiuretic hormone (ADH), the
                        hormone responsible for increasing water reabsorption into the blood. The pituitary gland stores
                        and releases ADH, produced by the hypothalamus. ADH acts on the kidneys and helps regulate water
                        balance in the body. ADH and other hormones, such as oxytocin, travel by way of specialized
                        nerve cells from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland stores the
                        hormones, releasing them in the blood, when necessary.</p>

                    <p>The cells that produce hormones in the <strong>pancreas</strong> are located in structures called
                        the <strong>islets of Langerhans</strong>. There are more than 2,000 tiny islets, each
                        containing thousands of beta or alpha cells. The <strong>beta cells</strong> produce the hormone
                        insulin, and the <strong>alpha cells</strong> produce the hormone glucagon.</p>

                    <h4>Diabetes mellitus</h4>
                    <p>An individual with <strong>diabetes mellitus</strong> cannot produce enough insulin to regulate
                        blood glucose levels. If left untreated, diabetes can cause blindness, kidney failure, nerve
                        damage, and in extreme cases, the need for limb amputation. </p>
                    <p>If a deficiency of insulin exists, blood sugar rises substantially, resulting in
                        <strong>hyperglycemia</strong> or high blood sugar. The symptoms associated with hyperglycemia
                        are:

                    <ol>
                        <li>Glucose in the urine.</li>
                        <li>Dehydration and thirst caused by glucose in the nephron, which in turn draws water out of
                            the blood through osmosis.</li>
                        <li>Low energy levels because of a lack of insulin, the permeability of glucose into the cells
                            does not increase, so less glucose is burned and less ATP is made.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>During times of stress, your body may need to tap into energy reserves. At such times, your

                    <p>The adrenal glands are found above each kidney. Each adrenal gland has:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>an inner medulla </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The medulla releases <strong>epinephrine</strong> (adrenalin) and
                        <strong>norepinephrine</strong>, which respond to short-term stress.

                    <p>Male hormones are called <strong>androgens</strong> (male sex hormone). The main androgen is
                        testosterone. </p>

                        <li>is also essential for the production of sperm (spermatogenesis). Testosterone is also

                    <ul>
                        <li>At puberty, the hypothalamus secretes the <strong>gonadotropin-releasing hormone
                                (GnRH)</strong>.</li>
                        <li>GnRH activates the pituitary gland to secrete and release follicle-stimulating hormone
                            <strong>(FSH)</strong> and luteinizing hormone <strong>(LH)</strong>.
                        </li>
                        <li>FSH acts directly on the sperm-producing cells of the seminiferous tubules.</li>
                        <li>LH stimulates the interstitial cells to produce testosterone.</li>
                        <li>Testosterone increases sperm production.</li>
                        <li>When high levels of testosterone result, the hypothalamus detects it and regulates the
                            process through negative feedback.</li>
                        <li>It is believed that the FSH acts on support cells, known as Sertoli cells, which produce a
                            peptide hormone called inhibin that sends a feedback message to the pituitary gland,
                            inhibiting production of FSH.</li>

                        approximately 400 eggs will mature during a female’s reproductive life.</p> <img

                        alt="In each female reproductive cycle, many follicles develop in a process called oogenesis in the ovaries which are part of the female reproductive system."
                        class="img-responsive">
                    <p>The actual age of the follicles can be linked to the higher incidence of genetic defects in
                        children produced by older women. This means that the longer the follicle lives, the greater the
                        chance of genetic damage. Menopause marks the end of a female’s reproductive life and signals a
                        drop in the production of female hormones.</p>
                    <p>When a woman is in the reproductive phase of her life, she undergoes ovulation once a month. </p>
                    <p><strong>Ovulation</strong> is the process of releasing a mature haploid egg (which contains 23
                        chromosomes instead of 46). </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The hormone FSH is released from the pituitary gland and stimulates the follicle (an
                            immature egg with 46 chromosomes) to develop into a haploid (a 23-chromosome) egg. </li>
                        <li>Luteinizing hormone (LH), also released by the pituitary gland, causes the follicle to be
                            released into the fallopian tube or oviduct. </li>
                        <li>The surrounding follicle cells remain within the ovary and are transformed into the corpus
                            luteum, which secretes the hormones necessary for pregnancy, only if the egg is fertilized
                            within 10 days. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If the egg is fertilized, the embryo then becomes attached to the lining of the uterus
                        (implantation). The cells of the placenta which nourishes the egg produce a hormone called the
                        Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This hormone will build up rapidly until about 11 weeks of
                        pregnancy. Both urine and blood pregnancy tests can detect the presence of hCG at about 12–14
                        days after conception. </p>
                    <h5>Menstrual cycle</h5>
                    <p>The entire menstrual cycle takes 28 days, with some degree of variation. The cycle is divided
                        into four distinct phases, as shown in the figure below.</p>

                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_05.03.27.jpg" style="margin: auto"
                        alt="Four phases of the female menstrual cycle" class="img-responsive">

                    <p>Here is what is happening at each of the four stages:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Flow phase</strong>—this is the shedding of the endometrium, or menstruation. This
                            phase marks the beginning of the menstrual cycle and lasts for approximately 5 days.</li>
                        <li><strong>Follicular phase</strong>—this phase is characterized by the development of the
                            follicles within the ovary. As the follicle cells develop, the hormone estrogen is secreted,
                            and its concentration increases. This takes place during days 6 to 13 of the cycle.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ovulatory phase</strong>—estrogen levels decline and the egg bursts from the ovary
                            and follicle cells differentiate into the corpus luteum.</li>
                        <li><strong>Luteal phase</strong>—in this phase, estrogen levels are restored as the corpus
                            luteum develops. This occurs between days 15 and 28 and prepares the uterus to receive a
                            fertilized egg, as the corpus luteum releases both estrogen and progesterone. These hormones
                            stimulate the endometrium (lining of the uterus or womb) and prepare the uterus for an
                            embryo. They also inhibit further ovulation and prevent uterine contractions from occurring.
                            If progesterone levels fall, uterine contractions begin. If fertilization does not occur,
                            the concentration of estrogen and progesterone drops, causing the endometrium to shed. This
                            shedding marks the end of the cycle and the beginning of the next.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Hormonal control of the female reproductive system</h4>

                    <p>The hypothalamus-pituitary complex regulates the production of estrogen and progesterone, the
                        hormones in the ovary as illustrated in the diagram below. </p>

                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_05.03.28.png" style="margin: auto" alt class="img-responsive">

                    <p>Both FSH and LH regulate the control of estrogen and progesterone. The amount of estrogen and
                        progesterone, in turn, regulates the release of FSH and LH from the pituitary gland in a
                        negative feedback loop.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At puberty, GnRH is released from the hypothalamus. </li>
                        <li>GnRH activates the pituitary gland, which releases FSH and LH.</li>
                        <li>FSH travels through the bloodstream and stimulates follicle development. The follicles then
                            secrete estrogen, which initiates the development of the endometrium.</li>
                        <li>LH stimulates ovulation and the remaining follicular cells to become the corpus luteum.</li>
                        <li>The corpus luteum secretes both estrogen and progesterone, which both further develop the
                            endometrium.</li>
                        <li>As these two hormones build up, a second negative feedback mechanism causes FSH and LH to
                            become inhibited, which causes the corpus luteum to degenerate, and menstruation begins.
                        </li>

                    <h3>Hormones affecting metabolism</h3>
                    <p>Have you ever known anyone who can eat copious amounts of food and never put on any weight? Or
                        perhaps you know someone who must closely monitor their food intake to remain at a healthy
                        weight. An individual’s metabolism is largely influenced by the endocrine system.</p>
                    <p>There are three different kinds of glands that affect metabolism:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Thyroid gland - regulates body metabolism and the rate at which blood glucose is metabolized
                            (hormones: triiodothyronine, thyroxine, and calcitonin).</li>
                        <li>Parathyroid glands - regulate calcium ion levels in the blood (hormone: parathyroid
                            hormone).</li>
                        <li>Anterior pituitary gland - influences the growth of long bones and accelerates protein
                            synthesis (hormone: growth hormone (somatotropin)).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Thyroid gland</h4>
                    <p>The thyroid gland is located at the base of the neck, in front of the windpipe and trachea.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_05.03.29.png" alt=" The thyroid gland in the human body"
                        class="img-responsive">
                    <p>The thyroid secretes three hormones: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) and triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) which both regulate body
                            metabolism and the growth and differentiation of tissues. </li>
                        <li>Calcitonin which acts on the bone cells to lower the level of calcium ions found in the
                            blood. More on this in the next section.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Here, we will focus on the metabolism regulating hormones of thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) and
                        triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>).</p>
                    <h5>Negative feedback mechanism of T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub></h5>
                    <p>The control of T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> occurs through a process of negative feedback.
                        This process is summarized below.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_05.03.30.png" alt class="img-responsive center-block">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Receptors in the hypothalamus are activated when the metabolic rate
                            decreases. </li>
                        <li>Nerve cells secrete thyroid-releasing hormone (TRH).</li>
                        <li>TRH stimulates the pituitary gland to release TSH.</li>
                        <li>TSH is carried through the blood and reaches the thyroid gland, which, in
                            turn, releases T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>.</li>
                        <li>T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> concentrations increase in the blood and
                            stimulate sugar oxidation.</li>
                        <li>When levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine increase to a critical point,
                            they cause the pathway to be “turned off ” by inhibiting the release of TRH
                            from the hypothalamus, thus stopping the production of TSH in the pituitary
                            gland (negative feedback).</li>

                        it gets stored in the liver. Once the liver reserves are full, the body converts sugar into fat.
                        People who secrete low levels of T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> often experience muscle

                    <h4>Parathyroid glands</h4>
                    <p>The parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH regulates blood calcium levels and
                        is another example of a negative feedback system. Low blood calcium levels trigger the release
                        of PTH.</p>
                    <h5>What happens when there is a decrease in blood calcium levels?</h5>
                    <p>Parathyroid hormone will work to increase the calcium levels using three methods:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Bones: It increases the blood calcium levels by accelerating the breakdown of bones to
                            produce higher calcium levels.</li>
                        <li>Kidneys: causes reabsorb calcium ions from the filtrate to increase levels.</li>
                        <li>Small intestine: causes absorption of calcium ions from undigested food to increase levels.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h5>What happens when there is an increase in blood calcium levels?</h5>
                    <p>The thyroid gland produces calcitonin which acts on bone cells to decrease the loss of calcium
                        from bones. Thus, decreasing the levels of calcium in the blood.</p>

                    <h4>Anterior pituitary gland</h4>

                    <p>The anterior pituitary gland secretes growth hormone (GH), which stimulates cell division. Low
                        secretions of GH during childhood can result in dwarfism, while high secretions can result in
                        gigantism.</p>

                        as many people regard it as a health hazard. BPA has been used for over 50 years in the plastics
                        industry and has many uses. It is found in many hard plastic toys, bottles, and food containers.
                        It is also used to line the cans used for canned goods, where it acts as a seal to prevent rust
                        from contaminating the food. Recently, many scientists and consumer groups have questioned the
                        safety of using BPA, especially in food packaging such as water bottles or food containers.</p>
                    <p>Critics of the use of BPA say that it may be linked to obesity, infertility, and insulin-
                        resistance in rodents. Some studies done on animals suggest that BPA may mimic estrogen and
                        other hormones when ingested, causing normal hormone functioning to be disrupted. This has led
                        to concern that BPA may cause early-onset puberty, and possibly breast and prostate cancer in
                        adults. It may also be linked to causing aggression in toddlers.</p>

                        class="img-responsive">
                    <p>In the past, the Canadian FDA (Food and Drug Administration) proclaimed BPA to be safe, but
                        recent political action has been taken to initiate further studies investigating the long-term
                        effects of BPA. For now, it is still uncertain whether BPA is safe.</p>
                    <p>In response to growing consumer concern, some Canadian-based stores have stopped selling bottles
                        containing BPA. As a consumer, you can purchase alternative containers made of glass, stainless
                        steel, or porcelain. This is particularly important if the containers are to be heated.</p>
