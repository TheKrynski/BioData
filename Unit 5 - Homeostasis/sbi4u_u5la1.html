                    <p>The human body requires a complex system to regulate its internal environment even when the external environment may change. Think about the external fluctuations in temperature. It may be very cold or very hot outside, but the human body has a relatively stable internal body temperature. </p>
                    <p>Some of the responses to external temperature changes may be behavioural or physiological. In your notebook, list as many behavioural or physiological responses to heat or cold as you can think of. Think about different animals and how they adapt to the changes in external temperature. A few examples are provided.</p>

                    <p>Living organisms function in a way that avoids environmental extremes. This “steady state” of being is known as <strong>homeostasis</strong>. In this unit, you will learn how homeostasis operates through feedback mechanisms, and why it is critical for maintaining a healthy body.</p>
                    <p>You will examine three body systems that play vital roles in maintaining homeostasis: the excretory, endocrine, and nervous systems. Throughout the unit, you will learn how your lifestyle choices can affect the functioning of these systems and the consequences that this has on your health.</p>

                    <h3>What is homeostasis?</h3>
                    <p>Your body is constantly adjusting to changes in its external environment to keep your internal environment at optimal levels for your health. These <strong>optimum levels</strong> include an internal body temperature of 37°C, blood sugar level of about 4 mmol/L and a blood pH of 7.35. The external environment does not usually provide these ideal conditions for living.</p>
                    <p>So, how does your body cope? In order to maintain a functional internal environment, your body’s organ systems must work together to maintain homeostasis when confronted with a fluctuating external environment.</p>
                    <p>Without you being aware of it, there is a lot going on inside you that needs to be regulated, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>water levels</li>
                        <li>food distribution and waste removal from your cells</li>
                        <li>temperature and pH adjustments</li>
                        <li>cellular activity (for example, biochemical metabolism, cellular respiration, DNA replication, cell division, protein synthesis, and so on)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The following graphs illustrate the acceptable range of fluctuations in physiological measures such as body temperature, blood pressure, blood glucose, and blood pH that the human body can tolerate. </p>
                    <p>Press on each physiological measure to explore each graph and examine how homeostatic measures maintain these systems in an acceptable range.</p>

                                    4. Output: Information sent along efferent pathway to Effector

                                    <p>Before you are introduced to a negative feedback system in the human body, let’s understand the components by using an analogy that you may be familiar with - a building’s thermostat system.</p>
                                    <h4 style="padding-top: 30px">Thermostat systems</h4>
                                    <p>The figure below illustrates how a thermostat system uses negative feedback to control the temperature of a room. </p>
                                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4U_05.01.12.svg" alt="The three functional components of a homeostatic control system" class="img-responsive">
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>The temperature monitor, the receptor in the thermostat, registers the room temperature, which is the <em>stimulus</em>. </li>
                                        <li>The<em> coordinating centre</em> compares this temperature to the temperature set by the resident.</li>
                                        <li>If the temperature in the room is too low, the thermostat sends a signal to the furnace to turn on. The furnace produces heat that warms up the room, and, thus, is the <em>effector </em>in this homeostatic control system.</li>
                                        <li>The temperature monitor records this warmth, and when it equals or exceeds the set temperature, the thermostat sends a signal to the furnace to turn off so that the room won’t get too hot. </li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <p>This is called a <strong>negative feedback system</strong> because a change in the variable being monitored (for example, room temperature) triggers the control mechanism to counteract any further change in the same direction. Negative feedback systems prevent small changes from getting too large and return the body back to homeostasis.</p>
                                    <h4 style="padding-top: 30px">The regulation of blood pressure</h4>
                                    <p>Most homeostatic control systems in your body use negative feedback. Using the room thermostat system as a model of a negative feedback look, let’s use the same components and see how it relates to the regulation of blood pressure in the human body. </p>

                                    <p>A positive feedback system is the opposite of a negative feedback system. It reinforces small changes to make them larger or amplified. Positive feedback moves the target variable even further away from its steady state, or increases the magnitude of the change away from the steady state, resulting in a change in the body’s status, rather than a return to homeostasis.</p>

                                    <p>This can sometimes be beneficial because it causes a process to be accomplished rapidly.

                    <p>When a baby is suckling during lactation (milk production), production of the hormone oxytocin is stimulated in the mother. This causes a contraction of the smooth muscle surrounding the milk duct, causing milk to flow. The flow of milk increases the baby’s suckling, and so more oxytocin is produced.</p>

                    <p>Like many other animals, humans can regulate their internal temperature. It is usually around 37&deg;C. Even when you are using heaters and air conditioners, your body still needs to work to maintain a constant internal temperature. The maintenance of body temperature within a range that enables cells to function efficiently is called <strong>thermoregulation.</strong></p>

                    <p>Most organisms cannot maintain a constant internal body temperature, regardless of their surroundings. These organisms are called <strong>ectotherms</strong><strong>,</strong> which means that their metabolic rates are dependent on external temperatures and other external elements. Invertebrates, as well as most fish, amphibians, and reptiles, are ectotherms.</p>

                    <p>Mammals (including humans) and birds are endotherms, because they are able to maintain a constant internal body temperature, regardless of their surroundings. They have evolved metabolic processes that generate internal heat from organs such as the kidney and liver. As a consequence, they are less vulnerable to changes in external temperatures.</p>

                    <p>However, endotherms still need to use a variety of physiological adaptations to counteract external changes in temperature. For example, when external temperatures drop, endotherms can compensate by increasing their rate of cellular respiration to generate internal heat, and if their internal temperature gets too high, they can use a variety of measures to shed the heat.</p>
                    <p>For many endotherms, including humans, the “thermostat” for thermoregulation is located in a region of the brain called the <strong>hypothalamus</strong><strong>.</strong> In humans, this thermostat is “set” at 37°C, but this is allowed to vary by one degree up or down, depending on conditions. </p>

                    <p>Although your body works hard to maintain this constant temperature, it can’t always manage it. Problems arise if the internal temperature gets too far above or below this optimal level, resulting in either heat or cold stress. The image below depicts many of the ways that the human body acts to maintain a healthy body temperature.</p>

                    <p>On October 7, 2007, race officials for the Chicago Marathon (held in Chicago, Illinois) called off the race after four hours when temperatures soared over 30°C under a hot sun. Although this may seem like a good temperature for a visit to the beach, it is much too hot for the average person taking part in an extreme athletic sport, like running a marathon.</p>

                    <p>Despite stopping the race early, over 300 runners were treated for heat-related problems, 50 were hospitalized, and one 35-year-old male runner died. The hospitalized runners were likely suffering from <strong>heat stress.</strong></p>

                    <p>Heat stress occurs when the body heats up beyond its tolerance limit because its built-in cooling mechanisms are unable to prevent overheating. This often happens as a result of extreme physical activity or spending too much time outdoors under intensely hot sunshine, or staying too long in a very hot location, like a sauna.</p>

                    <p>There is a limit to how much heat can be eliminated using these approaches. When this limit is reached, people start to suffer from heat stroke, resulting in fainting, dizziness, and, occasionally, death. Even before the heat stroke limit is reached, complications can arise from the cooling system’s activities.</p>
                    <p>For example, cooling the body using sweat requires a lot of water. If the lost water is not replenished, it can lead to many problems, including loss of cellular functions, kidney problems, thickened blood, muscle cramps, and nausea. Also, sweat carries valuable salts with it, so when the body sweats, it loses these dissolved substances (which are left behind on the skin’s surface). That is why athletes need to drink fluids that contain electrolytes (salts) in order to ensure that they are replenishing the water and electrolytes lost. Your kidneys also play a role in this process, as you will learn in the next lesson.</p>

                                    <p>In addition to blood flow changes, nerve messages are also carried to the smooth muscle that surrounds the hair follicles in your skin. The smooth muscle contracts, which causes your skin to tighten and your hair to stand up (a sensation commonly known as “goosebumps”). When the hair is erect, it traps a layer of warm air next to the surface of the skin, which helps to reduce heat loss. This is especially important for animals that have lots of hair or fur. Thus, this mechanism does not help for humans.</p>

                                    <p>The hypothalamus also sends messages that initiate <strong>shivering</strong>, a rhythmic contraction of skeletal muscle that stimulates ATP production and generates heat, so that the blood can transport the heat around your body. If exposure to the cold is prolonged, your body creates a hormonal response that elevates its metabolic rate, which ultimately provides the source of the heat in your body.</p>

                    <p>Now that you have learned about the dangers of heat stroke and extreme cold exposure, you may choose to make an infographic (poster) to inform people how to recognize the signs and symptoms of heat stroke and hypothermia. Be sure to include when to seek professional medical attention. Once you have created a poster, you may want to choose a way to pass on this very important information that may help others. It could be by tweeting it using Twitter, posting it on Facebook, posting on Instagram, or perhaps just sending it by email to those you care about.</p>
