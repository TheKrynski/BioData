                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>As you have learned, homeostasis is about maintaining an optimal internal environment in the
                        body. To do this, your body needs to sense the external environment and then act to restore its
                        optimal internal conditions. Sensing and acting are two specialties of the nervous system.</p>

                        class="img-responsive img-left-50">
                    <p>The nervous system is a specialized organ system that connects the external environment to the
                        internal environment and helps to maintain homeostasis. For example, this girl is running
                        through a water sprinkler to cool down on a summer day because her nervous system senses her
                        internal temperature is rising, and consequently, the action she consciously chooses is to run
                        through a water sprinkler to cool down.</p>

                    <p>Your nervous system is a network of specialized cells that communicate information about your
                        surroundings and your internal state. It processes this information and causes reactions
                        throughout your body. The nervous system is linked to all systems of the body, including the
                        cardiovascular, respiratory, and endocrine systems. It is crucial to maintaining homeostasis
                        within your body</p>

                    <h3>Anatomy of nerve cells</h3>
                    <p>The nervous system contains two types of <strong>nerve cells: </strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Glial cells </li>
                        <li>Neurons</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Glial cells</h4>
                    <p>Glial cells are non-conducting cells. They provide structural support and perform metabolic
                        functions for the nervous system. For example, the myelin sheath cells that surround nerves act
                        as a
                        kind of insulation, ensuring efficient transmission of electric charge.</p>

                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_05.04.08.jpg" style="width: 75%; margin: auto"

                        class="img-responsive">

                    <h4>Neurons</h4>
                    <p>Neurons are the functional units of the nervous system, as seen in the image below. There are
                        three types of neurons:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Sensory neurons</strong>:
                            These neurons sense and relay information from the environment to the CNS for processing.
                            They are located in clusters called ganglia.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Interneurons</strong>:
                            These neurons link neurons within the body and are found mostly throughout the brain and
                            spinal cord. They integrate and interpret the sensory information and connect neurons to
                            outgoing motor neurons.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Motor neurons (also known as efferent neurons)</strong>: These neurons send
                            information to the “effectors.” Effectors are muscles, organs, and glands.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Take a closer look at the anatomy of a neuron by examining the image below, which shows the parts
                        of a typical neuron, including the parts of the axon. All neurons are made up of three parts:
                        dendrites, the cell body, and the axon.</p>

                                    <p>The axon is an extension of a neuron. It carries nerve impulses away from the
                                        cell body towards other neurons or <strong>effectors.</strong> Axons are
                                        extremely thin; about 100 of them could fit inside the shaft of a single human
                                        hair. The axon has several parts.</p>
                                    <p>Axons are often covered with a white coat of fatty protein called the
                                        <strong>myelin sheath.</strong> The myelin sheath provides insulation for the
                                        neurons, to prevent the loss of charged ions from the nerve cell (like
                                        insulation around an electrical wire). The myelin sheath is formed by special
                                        glial cells called <strong>Schwann cells,</strong> which wrap themselves around
                                        the axon.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The areas between the sections of myelin sheath are known as<strong> the nodes of
                                            Ranvier.</strong> Nerve impulses jump from node to node, which speeds up the
                                        conduction process. Nerve impulses move much faster along myelinated nerve
                                        fibres than they do along non- myelinated nerve fibres.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes, a situation calls for immediate action, where you don’t have time to think about it.
                        For example, when you touch something really hot, your immediate response is to pull away. This
                        is called a <strong>reflex</strong> and it occurs even before the brain gets the message. This

                    <h3>Reflex arc</h3>
                    <p>A <strong>reflex arc </strong>is a simple neural circuit that runs through the spinal cord. It
                        provides a way for a reflex action to occur. </p>
                    <p>The neural circuit of a reflex arc is shown with the steps detailed below.</p>

                    <p>A reflex arc begins with a <strong>stimulus</strong>, such as a burning your finger.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The heat on your finger triggers a <strong>sensory receptor</strong> in your skin. The
                            sensory receptor sends the stimulus to the <strong>spinal cord. </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Interneurons </strong>in the spinal cord receive the information and immediately
                            send a signal to the motor neurons. </li>
                        <li>The <strong>motor neurons</strong> activate an effector organ (for example, the muscles).
                        </li>
                        <li>The <strong>effector organ</strong>, in this case a muscle, causes an immediate response,
                            such as pulling your hand away.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Reflexes are involuntary because you don’t have time to think about them. In a fraction of a
                        second, the stimulus has gone from the sensory receptors to the spinal cord and back to the
                        motor neurons. </p>

                    <h3>The nerve impulse</h3>
                    <p>An electrical current is generated in the nerves and muscles of the body. The electrical current
                        is
                        carried through the body in nerve impulses that travel along neurons. <em>Nerve impulses are
                            electrochemical messages created by the movement of ions through the nerve cell
                            membrane.</em> When a nerve gets stimulated (for example, by a pinprick or the sight of
                        someone’s face), a rapid change occurs in the electrical potential difference (commonly just
                        called “potential”) across the nerve membrane.</p>
                    <h4 class="margin-top-xl">How a nerve impulse is formed</h4>
                    <p>The neuron has a membrane that has differing amounts and types of ions inside and outside. At
                        rest, the potential across the axon membrane is around –70 mV. This means that the inside of the
                        axon is more negative than the outside. The voltage difference across the membrane during the
                        resting stage is called the <strong>resting potential. </strong></p>
                    <p>When the axon becomes stimulated, a rapid change occurs in the electrical potential difference
                        across the membrane, so it now registers +40 mV. This means that the inside of the axon is now
                        more positive than the outside. This reversal of potential is called an <strong>action
                            potential</strong><strong>, </strong>which is the voltage difference across a nerve cell
                        membrane when the nerve is excited.</p>
                    <p>An action potential lasts only a few milliseconds before the axon returns to its resting
                        potential value of –70 mV.</p>

                                        transport to pump out Na<sup>+</sup> ions and pump in K<sup>+</sup> ions at a
                                        ratio of 3:2. This means that for every three Na<sup>+</sup> ions pushed out,
                                        only two K<sup>+</sup> ions are pulled in. The result is that the nerve cell
                                        loses a greater number of positive ions than it gains, making the inside of the

                    <h4>Depolarization: How an action potential is formed</h4>
                    <p>When the nerve is excited by a stimulus, a section of the cell membrane becomes more permeable to
                        sodium than potassium. </p>

                        class="img-responsive">
                    <p>Sodium ions rush into the nerve cell because of the electrochemical gradient. The rapid influx of
                        sodium ions causes a charge reversal known as <strong>depolarization</strong>. Once the charge
                        on the inside becomes positive, the sodium gates close, stopping the influx of sodium.</p>

                    <p>Depolarization does not last long. As soon as the inside of the cell becomes positive, the
                        sodium-potassium pump in the cell membrane starts up again to push sodium out and pull potassium
                        in. The process of restoring the original polarity of the nerve membrane is called
                        <strong>repolarization.</strong> Nerves can’t be activated again until the repolarization
                        process is complete. The time required for the nerve cell to become repolarized is called the
                        <strong>refractory period</strong>, and it usually lasts 1 to 10 ms.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="margin-top-xl">Propagation of the action potential</h4>
                    <p>The movement of sodium ions into the nerve cell causes the local depolarization of the membrane.
                        This triggers an action potential in that region of the membrane.
                    </p>
                    <p>In order for this impulse to be conducted along the axon, it must move from the point of initial
                        depolarization down along the axon in a wave. How does this happen?</p>
                    <p>In the local region of the action potential, three things happen at the membrane:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The positively charged sodium ions move into the cell through the open gates of the sodium
                            channel. This causes local depolarization of the membrane.</li>
                        <li>The positively charged sodium ions are attracted to their neighbouring negative ions, which
                            are lying on the same side of the membrane.</li>
                        <li>If enough sodium ions move, this stimulates the sodium gates on the nearby resting membrane
                            to open, so that it will become depolarized. Because the membrane on the other side of the
                            action potential had previously been depolarized, it is still in its refractory phase, so it
                            can’t depolarize for a while. This forces the nerve impulse to travel in only one direction
                            along the nerve. This is shown below. </li>
                    </ol>
                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_05.04.24.svg" alt="Propagation of the action potential. "
                        class="img-responsive">
                    <p>Positive ions are attracted towards negative ions in adjacent membrane areas as an action
                        potential happens at one site. This triggers the sodium gates to open in the neighbouring
                        membrane area so that depolarization can occur. </p>
                    <p>Since the membrane to the left of the action potential is still in its refractory phase, it can’t
                        be depolarized again, which means that the nerve impulse can only travel to the right in this
                        diagram. The result is a wave of action potential that moves in one direction along the cell
                        membrane. The wave of action potential and depolarization is followed by a wave of
                        repolarization, which gets the nerve ready to transmit the next signal.</p>
                    <h4 class="margin-top-xl">Threshold levels and the all-or-none response</h4>
                    <p>The stimulus must generate a depolarization at or above a certain voltage in order to produce a
                        response in the nerve. This critical level is known as the <strong>threshold level.</strong></p>
                    <p>However, increasing the intensity of the stimuli above the critical threshold level will not
                        produce an increased response. The intensity of the nerve impulse and speed of transmission are
                        constant. This is called the <strong>“all-or-none”</strong> response. It means that neurons
                        either fire at full intensity or not at all. The graphs here illustrate how an action potential
                        is only triggered when the depolarization caused by a stimulus reaches a threshold level.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_05.04.25.svg"
                        alt="All-or-none response in an action potential. If the stimulus does not change the voltage across the membrane by an amount sufficient to reach the threshold level amount (in this case, above –55 mV), then no action potential occurs. In this example, the nerve takes about 3 ms after the peak of the action potential before the resting potential is restored and the nerve is ready to fire again."
                        class="img-responsive">

                    <p>However, even though the responses of individual nerves to stimuli are either “all” or “none,”
                        the brain is still able to recognize the differences between two stimuli of different
                        intensities. The simplest way it does this is by counting up the number of nerves responding. In
                        most cases, the more intense the stimulus, the greater the number of nerve cells stimulated, and
                        so the higher the number of impulses reaching the brain.</p>
                    <p>For example, holding a cup of soup warmed to 60°C causes more heat-sensitive neurons in your
                        fingers to fire than if you were holding a cup at 50°C. In most cases, the brain adjusts the
                        size of its response to the number of nerve impulses it receives.</p>

                        which one nerve cell communicates with another nerve cell is called <strong>synaptic
                            transmission.</strong></p>
                    <p>Nerves are not directly connected to each other or to their effectors (for example, the
                        muscles). There is a slight gap between the axon of one nerve and the dendrite of
                        another. These small spaces between neurons, or between neurons and effectors, are

                        <p>When the nerve is excited because of a stimulus, the cell membrane becomes more permeable to
                            sodium than potassium.</p>
                        <p>The sodium gates open, while the potassium gates close.</p>
                        <p>Sodium ions rush into the nerve cell because of the electrochemical gradient. This process is
                            known as depolarization.</p>
                        <p>Once the charge on the inside becomes positive, the sodium gates close, stopping the influx
                            of sodium.</p>
                        <p>The sodium-potassium pump restores the condition of the resting membrane by transporting
                            sodium ions out of the neuron while moving potassium ions into the neuron, at a ratio of 3
                            Na<sup>+</sup> to 2 K<sup>+</sup> ions.</p>
                        <p>The energy for the pump comes from ATP, and the process of restoring the original polarity of
                            the nerve membrane is called repolarization.</p>
                        <p>During synaptic transmission, a neurotransmitter travels through the synaptic cleft (the gap
                            between neurons) and binds to a receptor on the post-synaptic membrane.</p>
                        <p>This results in the nerve impulse being transmitted down the next neuron.</p>

                    <p>The central nervous system (CNS) includes the <strong>brain</strong> and <strong>spinal
                            cord.</strong></p>
                    <p>The brain is a concentration of nervous tissue that acts as the coordinating centre of the
                        nervous system. The brain is covered by a three-layered protective membrane known as
                        <strong>meninges.</strong> These three membrane layers form the <strong>blood-brain
                            barrier,</strong> which determines what chemicals in the blood will reach the brain.
                    </p>
                    <p>A fluid called <strong>cerebrospinal fluid</strong> is found between the innermost and middle
                        layers of the meninges of the brain, and also through the central canal of the spinal cord. It
                        functions as both a shock absorber and a transport medium for carrying nutrients to the brain
                        cells, while it takes wastes from the brain cells to the blood.</p>
                    <h3>The spinal cord</h3>
                    <p>The spinal cord carries sensory nerve messages from receptors in the body to the brain, as well
                        as carrying nerve messages from the brain to the muscles, organs, and glands. Below is a
                        flowchart describing this process in more detail. </p>

                        <li><strong>Grey matter</strong>&#8212;the core of the spinal cord consists of unmyelinated

                        explosion, an iron rod 2.5 centimetres thick and nearly a metre long was driven through his
                        skull. The rod entered his head through his left cheek, passed up behind his left eye, and
                        destroyed part of his brain. Amazingly, Gage recovered. However, he began to have startling
                        changes in personality and mood. He became rude, loud, and antisocial, and could no longer hold
                        down a job. His friends said that, “Gage was no longer Gage”. He died in 1861, 13 years after
                        the accident, penniless and suffering from epilepsy. No autopsy was performed on his brain.</p>

                    <h2>The autonomic nervous system and homeostasis</h2>
                    <p>The <strong>autonomic</strong> system is part of the peripheral nervous system that regulates
                        organs of the body <strong>without conscious control</strong>. It works with the endocrine
                        system to adjust the body to changes that take place in external and internal environments.
                    </p>
                    <p>The following examples are all controlled by the motor neurons of the autonomic nervous system:
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
                    <p>The autonomic nervous system, as seen below, is made up of two distinct, opposing units: </p>

                        <li>the sympathetic nervous system </li>

                    <h2>Part 3: Preparing for the Unit 5 Assessment – Case Study</h2>
                    <p>Your next task once you complete this learning activity will be to complete the unit 5 assessment
                        for grading. This assessment will account for 12% of your grade. Review your notes and content
                        from this unit before you begin the assessment. The assessment will consist of several questions
                        relating to the content from this unit, as well as the submission of a case study that you
                        create
                        on your own. You should prepare the case study for submission before beginning to answer the
                        rest of the questions. You will submit this with the rest of the questions from the unit 5
                        assessment. The instructions for the case study are listed below: </p>
                    <p><strong>Overall Task:</strong> Write a case study that could be used in a Grade 12 biology class
                        to help biology students learn to diagnose a disease related to homeostasis.</p>
                    <p><strong>Assessment Details:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. Choose a disorder or disease that is mentioned or described in the Homeostasis Unit, or select
                        one from the list below.</p>
                    <p>2. Write a synopsis or story of the patient’s life in a certain time period leading up to the
                        doctor’s visit.</p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">Note: this can highlight the events in the patient’s past, and/or be
                        a brief look at a specific
                        moment in the patient’s immediate past.</p>
                    <p>3. Provide mock lab tests (blood, urine, etc.) and state the results. Also, make reference to the
                        normal range values. This should be researched and cited from reputable Internet sources.</p>
                    <p>4. Many case studies used to educate biology students provide questions to be answered by the
                        student. Write a minimum of ten (10) questions that would be posed to a biology student to gain
                        understanding of the disorder or disease. Be sure to base some of the questions on the details
                        of the synopsis or story.</p>
                    <p>5. Provide detailed answers to these questions in full sentences (e.g. an answer key for the case
                        study questions).</p>
                    <p>6. Explain the diagnosis and treatment that a medical practitioner might make.</p>
                    <p>7. Explain the underlying causes of the disorder or disease.</p>
                    <p>8. Provide the final list of references that you used. Proper APA format must be used.</p>
