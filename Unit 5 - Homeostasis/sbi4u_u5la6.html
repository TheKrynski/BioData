                <h1>Assessment for Grading</h1>
                <h2>Final Project - Journal Study</h2>
                <p>This is an assessment for grading. This assessment is worth 15% of your course grade. </p>
                <p>You will now use the feedback you have collected throughout the course to complete one final journal
                    study to submit for grading. </p>
                <p>Instructions:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Select one of the following topics:
                        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                            <li>Sleep recovery and metabolic dysregulation</li>
                            <li>Importance of sleep on repairing DNA</li>
                            <li>Neanderthal diet</li>
                            <li>3D printing mouthguards for releasing medication</li>
                            <li>Xenotransplantation and biotechnology</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>For your selected topic you can search on your own for an academic journal article related to
                        the topic, or use the suggested article linked below.</li>
                    <li>Find 1 or 2 articles in the media referencing that research and critique them. This should be 1
                        paragraph stating if the article is an accurate reflection of the research, if there is any
                        bias, any improvements that you would suggest. </li>
                    <li>Write a summary paragraph about the research and submit for grading.</li>
                    <li>Write a 1-page reflection (250 words) on what you have learned in this course about primary and
                        secondary sources in scientific research. Consider the following prompts in your reflection. You
                        do not need to answer each question, just use the prompts to help guide your writing. </li>
                </ol>

                <p>Prompts:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>What is the difference between primary and secondary sources?</li>
                    <li>How difficult can primary sources be to interpret? </li>
                    <li>What are some of the hazards of using secondary sources? </li>
                    <li>Are all secondary sources entirely accurate? </li>
                    <li>What are some things to look for in secondary sources to help you identify if they are good
                        sources or not? </li>
                    <li>How difficult do you find paraphrasing? Did you learn any tips and tricks to help you
                        paraphrase? </li>
                </ul>

                                completing their own laboratory study.

                <h2>Preparing for the Final Test </h2>

                <p>Congratulations, you have almost completed this course. Your next steps are to prepare to write the
                    final test. </p>

                <h3>Step 1: Preparation</h3>

                <p>To prepare for the final test you should first make a plan. Begin by creating a collection of
                    strategies for doing well and studying for the final test. You may make this list of strategies by
                    searching online or by interviewing teachers, educators, elders or experienced students. From this
                    list, make a plan to study for the test. Consider strategies such as reviewing previous assessments
                    and feedback, location/environment for studying, making notes, and so on. Two strategies that are
                    essential and should be part of your collection:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Review your journal and any notes you have taken throughout the course.</li>
                    <li>Preview the Practice Test, to help you understand what the test will look like and what types of
                        questions you can expect.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This may help you make your plan for studying. Now that you have your collection of strategies, you
                    need to consider time to prepare. Take a look at the calendar and list what you are going to do,
                    when and for how long. Consider your other commitments and responsibilities. Remember to balance
                    your day and take breaks.</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Practice Test</h3>

                <p>Once you think you are ready and have studied the concepts from this course, including your notes and
                    previous assessments, try the practice test. After completing the practice test within the two-hour
                    time limit, compare your answers to the suggested answers. Consider what areas you can improve on
                    and spend some extra time focusing on these areas before writing the practice test.</p>
