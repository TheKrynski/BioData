          <h2>Enzymes and their importance</h2>
          <p>
            Millions of reactions take place every day in cells, and most of
            these reactions are able to occur at an optimal rate, thanks to
            the work of enzymes. Enzymes are protein catalysts that speed up
            chemical reactions, without being consumed by the reactions
            themselves. In most cases, enzymes make reactions happen millions
            of times faster than they would without a catalyst.
          </p>
          <h3>What are enzymes composed of?</h3>
          <p>
            Enzymes are proteins; they are composed of amino acids arranged in
            tertiary or quaternary structures, with complex conformations
            (shapes).
          </p>
          <h3>How do enzymes function?</h3>
          <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_02.04.06.jpg" alt="Enzyme" class="img-responsive img-right-50" />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Enzymes can be used to join together two molecules or break one
              molecule into two parts.
            </li>
            <li>The names of enzymes usually end in &#x201C;-ase.&#x201D;</li>
            <li>
              For the examples described below the enzymes involved break a
              complex sugar molecule down into monosaccharide monomers.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Examples:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              a specific enzyme called maltase hydrolyzes (or breaks down)
              maltose into glucose monomers
            </li>
            <li>
              sucrase is an enzyme used to break down sucrose into glucose and
              fructose monomers
            </li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Enzymes are specific to a particular substrate (reactant). For
              instance, the enzyme maltase cannot hydrolyze the substrate
              sucrose, and sucrase cannot hydrolyze maltose.
            </li>
          </ul>

            alt="The enzyme Sucrase breaking down sucrose into its constituent monomer of glucose and fructose"
            class="img-responsive" />
          <h3>How do enzymes help reactions to occur?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In order for a reaction to occur, the reactions have to overcome
              the activation energy (Ea) barrier.
            </li>
            <li>
              The activation energy is the amount of energy that must be
              available in order for a reaction to occur.
            </li>
            <li>Enzymes work by lowering the activation energy.</li>
          </ul>
          <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_02.04.09.svg"
            alt="Enzymes lower the activation energy required for chemical reactions to occur" class="img-responsive" />
          <p>
            A graph of the activation energy required for a chemical reaction
            is shown here. When no enzyme is present the activation energy
            required to complete the reaction is much higher than when an
            enzyme is present.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is an analogy to how enzymes work by lowering the activation
            energy.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Without the catalyst, that path the reactants take to become
              products is longer and slower as seen by the man pushing the
              wheelbarrow with the reactants up the hill.
            </li>
            <li>
              With the catalyst, the path the reactants take to become
              products is shorter and faster as seen by the man pushing the
              reactants down the hill.

            alt="A representation of an enzyme. The substrate fits tightly into the active site on the enzyme because the shapes are similar"
            class="img-responsive img-left-50" />
          <p>
            How does the structure of enzymes allow them to lower the
            activation energy of reactions and increase the speed chemical
            reaction? Enzymes lower the activation energy required for the
            reaction to occur by attaching to the reactants and positioning
            them so that they are in the optimal orientation to break or make
            chemical bonds between them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reactants attach to special sites on the enzyme called
            &#x201C;<strong>active sites</strong>.&#x201D;
          </p>
          <p>
            When reactants begin to interact with enzymes, they are called
            substrates. Each substrate binds to the active site that is shaped
            exactly to fit that particular substrate, and no other. This is
            what makes enzymes very specific. The enzyme and its attached
            substrate form a structure called an &#x201C;enzyme-substrate
            complex.&#x201D;
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the substrate begins to attach, the active site changes shape
            slightly to hold on to the substrate and fine-tune its position.
            (It&#x2019;s similar to what happens with your hand when you catch
            a ball: your fingers automatically wrap around the ball to ensure
            that you don&#x2019;t drop it.)
          </p>
          <p>
            This change in shape (conformation) is called &#x201C;induced
            fit.&#x201D; The active site continues to change shape until the
            substrate is completely bound.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the substrate is bound and optimally positioned by induced
            fit, the reaction can proceed to form or break chemical bonds. The
            process of induced fit for splitting apart a molecule into two
            parts is shown in the following image. The process works in a
            similar way to combine two molecules into one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the enzyme is released unchanged, ready to react again
            with a new substrate molecule.

            Let&#x2019;s examine a specific example of how enzymes catalyze a
            reaction.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The enzyme and substrate first combine on a specific area of the
              enzyme called the active site, to form the enzyme substrate
              complex.
            </li>
            <li>
              In this example, the enzyme is sucrase and the substrate is
              sucrose.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, the enzyme substrate complex combines with water
              (hydrolysis), which changes the shape of the enzyme slightly so
              that the substrate can break apart into glucose and fructose
              more easily.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, the reaction takes place and the sucrose molecule is
              broken up into the two monomers, fructose and glucose.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, the enzyme is released unchanged, ready to react again
              with a new substrate molecule.
            </li>
          </ul>

            What is the mechanism by which enzymes reduce activation energy in
            catabolic and anabolic reactions?
          </p>
          <h4>When splitting a molecule apart - a catabolic reaction</h4>
          <p>
            Enzymes decrease the energy of activation by stretching and
            bending chemical bonds that need to break during the reaction.
            This is similar to bending a thin twig so that it won&#x2019;t
            take much additional energy to snap it.

            class="img-responsive" />
          <h4>When joining two molecules together - an anabolic reaction</h4>
          <p>
            Enzymes decrease the energy of activation by forcing the molecules
            together in just the right way to cause bonds to form more easily.
            This is similar to what you do when you snap a button together:
            only when the two parts are perfectly positioned can you easily
            snap them together.

              Coenzymes are &#x201C;helpers&#x201D; molecules to enzymes and
              they help by moving molecules form one enzyme to another.
            </p>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Enzymes can also change the chemical environment around a molecule
            to encourage a reaction. For example, it is thought that the
            acidic active site of the enzyme may provide the low pH
            environment needed for certain reactions to take place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enzymes may also need to work with other molecules as helpers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some enzymes require either non-protein cofactors, such as
            inorganic substances (Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>) or organic
            coenzymes, before they can work properly. Coenzymes help by moving
            molecules from one enzyme to another. Many coenzymes are derived
            from vitamins. For example, the coenzyme NAD<sup>&#x2013;</sup> is
            a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin). The animation below further
            demonstrates the mechanism by which coenzymes work.

            Digestion involves thousands of chemical reactions that serve to
            break down your food into the basic building blocks of glucose,
            fats, and amino acids that your body needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            One critical enzyme in this process is called pepsin. This enzyme
            is secreted into the stomach, where it breaks down proteins into
            smaller fragments called peptides, so that they can be broken down
            further in the small intestine. If this enzyme&#x2019;s levels are
            too low, or its action is blocked (or &#x201C;inhibited&#x201D;),
            then many proteins, like gluten (found in wheat and other grain
            products) and casein (found in dairy products), are not completely
            digested, resulting in many health problems.
          </p>

            Respiration is the cellular process in which glucose is reacted
            with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water, while releasing
            energy in controlled stages.
          </p>
          <p>
            One enzyme critical in this process is called cytochrome c
            oxidase. This enzyme helps to combine the highly reactive waste
            oxygen molecules produced during this process with hydrogen, to
            create water. If this enzyme is absent, or its function is
            inhibited, then the process of cellular respiration stops within
            seconds and death is rapid. Carbon monoxide is a potent inhibitor
            of this enzyme. Because this gas is potentially so lethal, it is
            now mandatory to have carbon monoxide detectors in houses.

          <p>
            Your brain also relies on many enzymes to maintain optimal
            conditions for neural processing. For example, the enzyme
            acetylcholinesterase breaks down acetylcholine, which is a neural
            transmitter. Acetylcholine is a chemical that helps signals to
            pass between nerve cells, but the system only works if the amount
            of acetylcholine is strictly regulated. If this enzyme is absent
            or inhibited, then excessive acetylcholine will accumulate in the
            nerve synapses. This will cause paralysis in the muscles,
            including those that control breathing, and lead to death. The
            venom of many poisonous snakes includes chemicals that block the
            activity of acetylcholinesterase.

          <h2>Enzymes in industry</h2>
          <p>
            Learn how enzymes are used in many industrial processes such as
            the food industry and as alternative fuels by exploring the
            pictures and reading the excerpts below.

          <h3>Enzymes in the food Industry</h3>
          <p>
            Enzyme applications are currently being researched and their
            function is widely exploited for a variety of applications in the
            food industry, such as baking, cheese production, starch
            processing, and the production of fruit juices. Enzymes can
            improve the food&#x2019;s texture and appearance, enhance its
            nutritional value, and give it desirable flavours and aromas.

          <h4>Bread-making</h4>
          <p>
            In bread-making, the enzyme amylase is used to break down flour
            (starch) into simple sugars, which are then converted by yeast
            into alcohol and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide produced makes
            the bread rise.

          <p>Benefits of using enzymes in food production</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Replacing synthetic chemicals</strong>, which lowers the
              amount of waste and energy consumed to produce the food product
            </li>
            <li>
              Allowing some reactions to occur that otherwise may not have
              occurred naturally. A good example of this is the enzyme
              <strong>pectinase</strong>, which is used to produce clear (not
              cloudy) apple juice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Providing specific action that allows for very specialized food
              products to be produced <strong>efficiently</strong>

            Most come from bacteria or yeast, but a few are obtained from
            plant and animal cells.
          </p>

            alt="Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) could be an important new source of ethanol fuel. It grows on land that is unsuitable for agriculture, so its cultivation would not harm food production"
            class="img-responsive img-right-50" />
          <p>
            Enzymes are at the forefront in the search for alternative fuels
            like ethanol.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cellulosic ethanol comes from agricultural waste, such as the corn
            stalks left behind after harvesting, or from a native grass called
            switchgrass <em>(Panicum virgatum)</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This ethanol is called cellulosic ethanol because it comes from
            cellulose.
          </p>
          <p>&#x25CF; Advantages of Cellulosic Ethanol:</p>
          <p>
            Using agricultural waste or switchgrass to produce ethanol would
            not compete with food production. This means that the critical
            food supplies needed to feed people would not be used for
            producing fuel instead.
          </p>
          <p>&#x25CF; Disadvantages of Cellulosic Ethanol:</p>
          <p>
            Currently, there is a problem with using agricultural waste and
            switchgrass for ethanol production because it does not ferment as
            easily as other agricultural products, like corn. Because of this,
            it does not yet produce ethanol abundantly or cheaply.
          </p>
          <p>&#x25CF; Current research:</p>
          <p>
            The secret to improving cellulosic ethanol production is to find
            enzymes that optimize the biochemical pathways that produce
            ethanol. Many Canadian companies are in the race to find or design
            new enzymes to make this type of alternative fuel production
            commercially practical.

          <h2>Enzyme activation and inhibition</h2>
          <p>
            Currently, there are millions of chemical reactions occurring in
            your body and many enzymes that are allowing these reactions to
            occur quickly and effectively. However, there are chemical
            reactions in your body that may not be required at certain points
            in the day and it is inefficient for those enzymes to be active or
            &#x201C;on&#x201D; when not required. In terms of efficiency,
            enzymes need to be monitored, in terms of when to be active (which
            is similar to having an &#x201C;on&#x201D; and &#x201C;off&#x201D;
            light switch in a room).
          </p>

              A Simplistic Representation of the Enzyme Lipase breaking down a
              tryiglyceride. This is a hydrolysis reaction and requires 3
              molecules of water and the presence of the enzyme lipase for the
              reaction to occur quickly in the body.

            For example, the enzyme lipase catalyzes the breakdown of
            triglycerides into glycerol and fatty acids, but this enzyme does
            not always need to be active. When your body requires energy from
            triglycerides, it will &#x201C;activate&#x201D; the lipase enzyme
            to break down fats. When it does not require the lipid energy, it
            will &#x201C;inhibit&#x201D; the lipase or &#x201C;turn it
            off.&#x201D;

              An enzyme has both active and allosteric sites. An allosteric

            The following section will explain each of these interesting
            mechanisms in detail.
          </p>
          <p>Enzymes carry out their function, in a variety of ways.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Recall that the <strong>active site</strong> on an enzyme is
              where specific reactants bind to become substrates either to
              form or break chemical bonds to make smaller or larger
              molecules, respectively.
            </li>
            <li>
              Large enzymes with more than one subunit contain more than one
              active site. Most enzymes also contain an additional site,
              called the <strong>allosteric site</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The allosteric site is a place on an enzyme:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  that will <strong>not</strong> bind substrates that bind to
                  the active site
                </li>
                <li>
                  that will bind to other specific molecules that will change
                  the shape of the enzyme and influence its ability to be
                  active or not.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The allosteric site is involved in turning the enzyme
              &#x201C;on&#x201D; and &#x201C;off.&#x201D;
            </li>

                    If an enzyme has more than one active site, then
                    competitive inhibition can act to slow down the rate of
                    reaction of the enzyme by blocking some active sites, but
                    leaving other active sites open to hold substrates.

                    The more active sites there are that are blocked by

            Recall that large enzymes with more than one subunit contain more
            than one active site and also contain an additional site, called
            the allosteric site, which is not an active site. The allosteric
            site is considered non-competitive because it cannot bind the same
            reactants that bind to the active site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allosteric (or non-competitive) activators and inhibitors are
            molecules that bind to the allosteric site (not the active site)
            on an enzyme.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allosteric regulation can provide a very sophisticated way to
            fine-tune the behaviour of an enzyme. This method of enzyme
            regulation is described in the next section.
          </p>
          <h2>Allosteric activators and inhibitors</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Enzymes can oscillate in shape between the &#x201C;on&#x201D;
              and &#x201C;off&#x201D; conformation.
            </li>
            <li>
              They can be temporarily locked into the &#x201C;on&#x201D; or
              &#x201C;off&#x201D; conformation by interacting with other
              molecules called
              <strong>allosteric activators and inhibitors.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              When these regulatory molecules bind to the allosteric or
              regulatory site on the enzyme, they force a change in the shape
              of the enzyme.
            </li>
            <li>
              The enzyme stays in the &#x201C;on&#x201D; or
              &#x201C;off&#x201D; position until the allosteric regulator is
              removed. Because only one regulatory molecule is needed to turn
              all of the active sites on the enzyme on or off, this is an
              efficient way to control enzyme function.

            Activation of enzyme activity occurs when allosteric activators

            of the <strong>active sites available</strong> for substrates to

            Inhibition of enzyme activity occurs when allosteric inhibitors

            and stabilize it to make all of the

          <h3>Feedback inhibition</h3>
          <p>
            Another type of enzyme regulation that occurs is called feedback
            inhibition.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              feedback inhibition occurs in metabolic pathways involving a
              series of sequential reactions in which each step is catalyzed
              by a specific enzyme
            </li>
            <li>
              it is a regulatory method of metabolic control that cells use in
              which products of a reaction allosterically inhibit an enzyme
              that catalyzes a reaction in the same metabolic pathway.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Feedback inhibition is an example of a
            <strong>negative feedback process</strong> because as the amount
            of product produced increases, the rate of the reaction decreases.

            In the image here, enzyme 1 catalyzes the production of product A
            from two substrate molecules. A metabolic pathway converts product
            A into product D, using three other enzymes. Product D can act as
            an allosteric inhibitor on enzyme 1. When the concentration of
            product D is high enough, it will inhibit all of the available
            enzyme 1 molecules, and so stop the production of product A. This
            effectively stops the metabolic process.

            Apart from activators and inhibitors, there are three other

                    <p class="small text-center">
                      pH is a factor that affects how well an enzyme will
                      operate. Pepsin is an enzyme found in the stomach and it
                      works best at around pH 2. Amylase is an enzyme found in
                      the mouth and it works best at around pH 5, which is the
                      normal pH of the mouth.

                  </figure>
                  <p>
                    Enzymes have optimal pH, depending on the environment of
                    the substrate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some enzymes work best at a neutral pH (7), while others
                    are active at acidic pH ranges (3&#x2013;4).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some digestive enzymes, such as pepsin (found in your
                    stomach), are active at acidic pH ranges. This is useful,
                    since most proteins are digested in your stomach, which is
                    an acidic environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Amylase, on the other hand, digests optimally at a
                    slightly acid pH similar to that found in your mouth. This
                    allows it to catalyze the breakdown of starch into simple
                    sugars in your mouth.

                    Every enzyme has an optimal temperature at which it works

                In this activity, which you can attempt on your own with
                household items, (or use the sample observations provided),
                you will investigate whether potatoes contain an enzyme,

                    The natural rate of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide
                    is slow but some damage to cells can occur before the
                    hydrogen peroxide is completely broken down.

                  <p>
                    An enzyme called <strong>catalase</strong> in cells speeds
                    up the rate of this reaction to reduce the risk of
                    exposure to hydrogen peroxide.

            2.What was the purpose of adding only water to half of the
            glasses?

            <p>
              Glass A acted as a control, proving that the catalase enzyme
              in the potato was breaking down the hydrogen peroxide, and
              not some other molecule that happened to be present in the
              water. Water was used as a control because the 3% hydrogen
              peroxide solution contained mostly water. If the enzyme was
              reacting only to the water in the hydrogen peroxide
              solution, then you would have seen similar reactions in both
              the water and hydrogen peroxide treatments. Because the
              reactions only occurred when hydrogen peroxide was added,
              this showed that the enzyme in the potato was reacting with
              the peroxide.

            <p>
              The enzyme should permit the reaction to occur effectively
              and the product oxygen should be produced.

            <p>
              Chopping up the potato increased the surface area, which
              increased the number of successful collisions that occurred
              between the substrate and the catalase&#x2019;s active site.

              Boiling the potato breaks up the enzyme, making the catalase

              40&#xB0;C is the closest to the normal body temperature of
              mammals (37&#xB0;C) which this enzyme is optimized for.

              The rate of reaction increases steadily at first as the
              temperature increases up to 40&#xB0;C. After that the rate
              of reaction declines as the temperature increases further.

            <p>
              The experiment was done twice to confirm that the data
              obtained were precise, and not flawed due to experimental
              error.

            <p>
              Increasing the substrate concentration level (hydrogen
              peroxide) will increase the rate of reaction; however, the
              saturation point will be reached eventually, and the rate
              will not increase any further.
