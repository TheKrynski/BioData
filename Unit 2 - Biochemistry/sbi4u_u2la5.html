          <h2>Cell structure </h2>
          <p>All living things are composed of one or more cells. The cell must be able to perform tasks, in order to
            stay alive. Cells have structures that enable them to ingest food, excrete waste, and, in some cases, move
            around. Specialized
            structures known as organelles work together to make a cell function effectively. Although individual cells
            may be modified to perform specific functions, most animal and plant cells share many of the same basic
            organelles. Most of your
            study in this course deals with plants and animals. The cells of plants and animals have membranes
            surrounding their organelles.</p>
          <p>Below are diagrams of a typical plant cell and animal cell.</p>
          <p><strong>Animal Cell</strong></p>

Around the nucleus, there are the rough endoplasmatic reticulum and the smooth endoplasmatic reticulum. There are also mitochondria, ribosomes, golgi apparatus, lysosomes, centrioles, microtubules, vacuoles inside of the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm is encapsulated with the plasma membrane."

          <h3>The cell membrane</h3>
          <p>The cell membrane separates the cytoplasm from the external environment. It acts like the cell’s
            <strong>“security guard,”</strong> controlling which chemicals can get in or out of the cell.
          </p>
          <p>The cell membrane allows essential molecules into the cell and allows metabolic waste to leave. This means
            that the inside of a cell can be kept chemically different from its external environment.</p>

                  <p>The head region is classified as hydrophilic (meaning “water-loving”) because it is water-soluble.
                  </p>
                  <p>The reason why the head end is hydrophilic is because it contains a polar phosphate
                    (PO<sub>4</sub>) group. Recall that the water molecule is also polar because it has a region of
                    positive charge and a region of negative charge.
                    Because polar molecules are attracted to other polar molecules, the head end is attracted to water
                    molecules.</p>

                  <p>This means that the tail end wants to point away from water. The hydrophobic tail contains one
                    glycerol molecule attached to two fatty-acid chains, which means that each part of the tail is
                    attracted to fats or oils because it is

                  <p>Having a water-seeking head and a fat-seeking tail means that two of these molecules will join
                    tail-to-tail when placed in water. This makes it the perfect molecule for constructing cell
                    membranes in a watery environment. Also,
                    you will note that in the image above of a phospholipid, one of the fatty acids is unsaturated,
                    meaning that it contains a double bond. This causes the molecules to slightly bend or kink. In the
                    next section, you will see how this
                    bending helps create passageways in the membrane.</p> <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_02.05.07.png"

                    Transport proteins move materials into or out of cells along the concentration gradient (from high

          <h3>Active transport</h3>
          <p>Sometimes, for a certain molecule to get inside a cell, it is necessary for a cell to create a large
            concentration gradient between the inside and outside of the cell. The movement of molecules, atoms, and
            ions against a concentration
            gradient across a cell membrane using the cell’s energy, in the form of ATP, is called active transport.
            This is sometimes also called an active transport pump because the cell is literally using energy to “pump”
            the molecules through the
            membrane, against the concentration gradient.</p>
          <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_02.05.20.jpg"
            alt="A transport molecule is in the cell membrane and is transporting a molecule from a lower concentration to the side with a higher concentration"
            class="img-responsive center-block">
          <p>Like facilitated diffusion, active transport relies on transport proteins to allow substances to pass
            through the membrane. Active transport, however, requires energy to move substances against the
            concentration gradient.</p>
          <p>A cell uses active transport to maintain an intracellular environment that is different from the
            environment outside the cell. For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It allows a cell to bring in and <strong>store nutrients</strong> that are already in high concentration
              inside the cell. </li>
            <li>It also allows a cell to completely <strong>remove harmful waste</strong> products from the
              intracellular environment. </li>
            <li>Active transport is necessary for <strong>homeostasis</strong>—a process by which a constant internal

          <h2>The use of vesicles to move very large molecules around</h2>
          <p>Up to this point we have examined how relatively small molecules are transported through the cell membrane
            via passive or active transport. However, some molecules are <strong>too large</strong> to be transported
            through the cell
            membrane. The cell uses a special method to move these molecules so that they <strong>do not</strong> have
            to pass through the phospholipid bilayer called <strong>vesicles</strong>. </p>
          <p>The cell membrane can fold in on itself to wrap around and seal large objects in a sac called a vesicle.
            Like active transport, the cell must <strong>expend energy</strong> to use vesicles, in order to transport
            larger molecules (such as
            proteins and polysaccharides) across the cell membrane.</p>
          <p>There are two ways in which vesicles are used to move materials <strong>across</strong> cell membranes
            called: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Endocytosis,</strong> which brings materials into the cell </li>
            <li><strong>Exocytosis,</strong> which takes material out of the cell </li>
          </ul>

          <br>
          <h3>Endocytosis</h3>
          <p><strong>Endocytosis</strong> is the process by which cells ingest (take in) large materials. A portion of
            the cell (plasma) membrane surrounds the material to be transported into the cell.</p>
          <p>The “pinched-in” portion eventually breaks free from the cell membrane and forms a vesicle in the
            cytoplasm. This allows the material within the vesicle to travel to its final destination within the cell.
          </p>
          <p>There are three main types of <strong>endocytosis</strong>: </p> <img
            src="../assets/img/sbi4u_02.05.25.jpg"
            alt="Three images. The first one shows phagocytosis - a larger piece of solid being surrounded by cell membrane to form a vessicle. The second shows pinocytosis - a small molecule being surrounded by cell membrane for form a vesicle. The third shows receptor mediated endocytosis where there are receptors on the cell membrane."

                  <p>Receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME) enables the cell to acquire bulk quantities of specific
                    substances. RME involves the use of receptors to recognize and bind molecules before they are
                    engulfed. During RME, the molecule that is
                    to enter the cell binds to special receptor proteins located on the outside of the cell membrane.
                    Once enough molecules have gathered in an area, the cell membrane pinches in, forming the vesicle
                    that will transport these
                    molecules into the cell.</p>
                  <p>This process is how molecules such as cholesterol enter the cell. If a person consumes too much
                    cholesterol in their diet, there won’t be enough receptors to handle it all. Instead, the
                    cholesterol builds up in the walls of the
                    arteries and veins where it hardens, forming a sticky substance called plaque. This excess plaque
                    can block blood vessels, leading to heart disease.</p>

          <h3>Exocytosis</h3>
          <p><strong>Exocytosis</strong> is the opposite of endocytosis. </p>
          <p>Exocytosis uses vesicles to export large molecules <strong>out of the cell</strong>. This is useful for
            removing large waste particles. </p>
          <p>For example, lysosomes often break down wastes and other toxins inside the cell, and these wastes are then
            transported out of the cell in a vesicle. The vesicle is transported through the cytoplasm to fuse with the
            cell membrane. The
            cell membrane rearranges, opens, and releases the contents of the vesicle outside the cell.</p> <img

            <p>Your answer may be different, depending on the texture of the potato you used, but your results should
              generally be similar to those in the sample data. In the sample data, both glasses showed changes in the
              potato volumes. In glass A,
              the potato grew by about 1.2 cm<sup>3</sup>, and in glass B, the potato shrank by about 1.4
              cm<sup>3</sup>. The shrinkage in glass B was greater than the growth in glass A, indicating that the salt
              solution in glass B was much saltier
              than the inside of the potato. In other words, there was greater osmotic potential in glass B than in
              glass A.</p>

            <p>In glass A, the potato's internal environment was hypertonic, in relation to the tap water. Therefore,
              water moved by osmosis from the glass into the potato’s cell, causing it to swell up. This was seen as an
              increase in size and
              volume.</p>
            <p>In glass B, the potato’s internal environment was hypotonic, in relation to the salty water. Thus, water
              moved out of the potato and into the glass. This caused the potato to shrivel up and become smaller in
              volume.</p>
