        <h1>Assessment for grading</h1>
        <p>This is an assessment for feedback and a grade. This assessment is worth 12% of your course grade.</p>
        <p>In this assessment you will revisit the case studies that you covered in this unit and summarize and present your findings in a format of your choice.</p>
        <p>Instructions</p>
        <h2>Part 1: Summarize your learning in case studies</h2>
        <p>1. J. Wellington Wimpy (from unit 2, learning activity 2)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Compare 1 meal of Wimpy’s before his transformation (burger meal) to 1 meal of his after his transformation (sub meal). For each meal (before and after), list the ingredients that were likely in his meal. Then compare the macromolecules available in each meal.</li>
          <li>Explain how these macromolecules break down in the body for energy. Include diagrams in your description. What are the major differences between the two meals? Is the turkey sub a healthier meal when looking at the macromolecules available?</li>
          <li>Provide some tips for Wimpy to make his meals even healthier.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>2. Lactose intolerance (from unit 2, learning activity 4)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Explain to Carol what is happening in her body - what does it mean to be lactose intolerant? Explain this using biology terms and concepts learned in this unit. Why does her doctor recommend that she eats yogurt?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>3. Hydration and dehydration (from unit 2, learning activity 5)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Who was correct? Ellie’s father or mother? Explain the process of getting wrinkly skin and how you know they were correct. Is what happens to skin in an ocean vs. a freshwater lake different or the same? Explain this using concepts and terms learned in this unit. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Part 2: Putting it all together </h2>
        <p>You will now put everything that you have learned in the three case studies together to present the cases. You may choose how you will present the cases. You may write a report, write a series of short stories, create comics, create a slide deck, create a video, create infographics and visuals, etc. You may be as creative as you like, just be sure to review the success criteria so that you include all the important concepts and requirements. For any diagrams needed you may draw or use appropriate images you find on the internet. If using images from the internet, be sure that they are appropriate and serve the purpose to explain the concept well. Sources of all images must be included. </p>
        <p>When you are ready, submit your presentation of all three cases. You should include your rough notes on the case studies as well. </p>
        <h3>Submission instructions:</h3>
        <p>When you are ready, submit your assessment for feedback and a grade by selecting the “Assignments” link and following the submission directions.</p>
