        <h2>Learning goals </h2>
        <p>We are learning to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>construct and draw three-dimensional molecular models of important biochemical compounds, including
                carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids</li>
            <li>conduct biological tests to identify biochemical compounds found in various food samples</li>
            <li>describe the structure of important biochemical compounds, including carbohydrates, proteins, lipids,
                and nucleic acids, and explain their function within cells</li>
            <li>identify common functional groups within biological molecules (for example, hydroxyl, carbonyl,
                carboxyl, amino, and phosphate groups), and explain how they contribute to the function of each molecule
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Success criteria</h2>
        <p>I am able to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>compare condensation (dehydration synthesis) reactions with hydrolysis reactions </li>
            <li>draw carbohydrates such as glucose and maltose </li>
            <li>draw the generic structures of amino acids and how a peptide bond is formed</li>
            <li>draw the generic structure of glycerol and three fatty acid chains and how they are bonded to form a
                lipid/fat</li>
            <li>analyze data from biological tests to determine the macromolecules found in food samples </li>
            <li>describe function of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids in cells</li>

                    <p>Macromolecules are &#x201C;big&#x201D; molecules classified as <strong>polymers</strong>.
                        Polymers are molecules that are created by many molecules put together. Imagine a necklace made
                        of beads. The beads are each the <strong>&#x201C;monomers&#x201D;</strong> or the single units
                        that are put together. The entire necklace is the polymer. </p>
                    <p>The macromolecules we are looking at in this course are <strong>carbon-based</strong> biological
                        molecules that contain <strong>functional
                            groups</strong>. </p>
                    <p>As you work through the rest of this course, you will notice functional groups in diagrams of
                        molecules. You will begin to recognize them with practice. The table below contains some common
                        functional groups. Note that an R represents side
                        chains or other parts of the molecule that the functional group is in.</p>
                    <p>The functional groups have specific properties that they provide to the molecules they are in.
                        Many are polar and contribute to the hydrophilic (attracted to water) nature of the molecule. A
                        few are considered acidic or basic. The table
                        below summarizes some of these characteristics. </p>

                    <p><strong>Macromolecules </strong>are large biological molecules. Biochemical reactions usually
                        involve using building blocks or smaller repeating units known as <strong>monomers</strong> to
                        build macromolecules
                        <strong>or</strong> breaking down macromolecules to form the monomers.

                    <h3 class="h4">Building Macromolecules: Condensation Reactions</h3>
                    <p>In order to join monomers to form macromolecules or polymers, water must be removed in a
                        <strong>condensation reaction</strong>. It is also sometimes called a <strong>dehydration
                            synthesis</strong> reaction
                        (because the molecule becomes &#x201C;dehydrated&#x201D;) and an <strong>anabolic</strong>
                        (building-up) reaction occurs, since larger units are formed from smaller units.</p>

                    <p>In order to break down macromolecules into smaller units, a <strong>catabolic (breaking down)
                        </strong>reaction called <strong>hydrolysis </strong>must occur. In this reaction, water is used
                        to break down the
                        macromolecule into its smaller monomer units.</p>

                                    <p>Many of the sugars in the foods we ingest are disaccharides, sugars made up by
                                        combining two monosaccharides. Table sugar is sucrose, which is made from

                                    <p><strong>Disaccharides</strong> are formed when two monosaccharides combine by a

                                        synthesis or condensation reaction. A glycosidic linkage is the covalent bond
                                        that forms between carbohydrates or carbohydrates and another group. </p>

                                        by covalent bonds, called glycosidic linkages and are also formed from

For this reason, it is called an alpha glycosidic 1-4 linkage."

                                        in cell communication during development. Cholesterol can also be
                                        converted into vitamin D. Too much cholesterol in your diet can lead to clogged
