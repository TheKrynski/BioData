                    <h2>Overview of aerobic cellular respiration </h2>
                    <p><strong>Aerobic cellular respiration</strong> is the process of capturing the energy of the
                        electrons that are shared in the covalent bonds (C-H) of glucose, using oxygen as a final
                        electron acceptor. The process results in the release of energy and the formation of water and
                        carbon dioxide as products:</p>

                    <p>Aerobic cellular respiration can be broken down into four main stages:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Glycolysis</li>
                        <li>Pyruvate oxidation</li>

                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>Aerobic cellular respiration</strong> uses energy-carrying coenzymes, enzymes, and
                        specialized structures within the mitochondria to incrementally extract the energy of the
                        electrons as they move toward their final electron acceptor, oxygen. </p>
                    <p>This catabolic, exothermic process follows the laws of thermodynamics. It generates free energy
                        in the form of ATP and loses energy as waste heat during every reaction.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>electrons</strong> that are stripped from glucose have a lot of potential energy. As
                        they move through the electron transport chain via <strong>redox</strong> reactions, the
                        electrons lose some energy in order to drive the proton pumps, and even more is lost as heat
                        (disorder). You can think of the electrons as being at the top of a flight of stairs and that at
                        every stage of the respiration process, they move down the staircase, converting their potential
                        energy to useable energy with every step.</p>

                    <p>Eukaryotic animal and plant cells are filled with cytoplasm. The cytoplasm of the cell is the

                        insulin. Once inside the cytoplasm of a cell, glucose is processed for its free
                        energy&#x2014;harvested as ATP&#x2014;to do immediate cellular work.</p>

                    <p>Glycolysis is a 10-step enzyme catalyzed reaction that takes place in the
                        <strong>cytoplasm</strong> of a eukaryotic cell. During glycolysis, each glucose (6 Carbons)
                        that has entered the cytoplasm of the cell is split into two 3-carbon molecules that eventually
                        become pyruvate (2 &#xD7; 3 Carbons). Collectively, this pathway prepares the energy-rich
                        glucose molecule for the extraction of the energy stored in its bonds. To accomplish this,
                        however, some energy has to be invested first, in order to destabilize the glucose molecule. Two
                        ATP molecules are expended initially by the cell, while four ATP and two NADH molecules are then
                        produced. Thus, the <em class="Italic">net yield of energy-carrying products is two ATP and two
                            NADH</em>. </p>
                    <p>The glycolysis stage of aerobic cellular respiration does not require oxygen.</p>
                    <p>Examine the glycolysis flowchart and learn the details of glycolysis in the table. There are many
                        intermediate compounds and enzymes in this process. You are not required to know each step;
                        rather, you are to know the key changes that occurs to glucose on its way to become pyruvate.

                            <li>The 10 NADH and two FADH<sub>2</sub> generated during the first three stages of aerobic
                                respiration through the oxidation of glucose now move into the folds of the inner
                                membrane within the matrix, called the cristae.</li>
                            <li>Various membrane-associated proteins and special compounds called cytochromes comprise a
                                series of increasingly strong reducers, called the electron transport chain (ETC). This
                                linear series of molecules carries out coupled redox reactions to pass on electrons from
                                the energy carriers FADH<sub>2</sub> and NADH to oxygen.</li>
                            <li>The electrons are passed along the ETC like a baton handed from runner to runner in a
                                relay race. With each transfer, the electrons occupy a slightly more stable position on
                                the carrier molecule. The energy they give up at each transfer is used to power the
                                proton pumps that pump the H<sup>+</sup> ions out of the matrix into the intermembrane
                                space. There are five steps in this series, which will be discussed next.</li>

                                            pump, called cytochrome C oxidase. </p>

                                            cytochrome C is used to pump H<sup>+</sup> out of the matrix into the
                                            intermembrane space, while the rest is lost as heat. The H<sup>+</sup> that
                                            are pumped out become concentrated as they build up in the intermembrane
                                            space. These charged atoms cannot easily move back across the membrane into
                                            the matrix.</p>
                                        <p>The result is that an electrochemical gradient is built up across the

                                            contains potential energy, which eventually gets used to make ATP.</p>

                                            One way to visualize this is to think of the ETC as a flight of stairs and

                                        <p>As electrons move through the electron transport chain via redox reactions,
                                            they lose some energy through driving the pumping of protons, and some is
                                            wasted as heat.</p>

                        <h2>Alternative metabolic pathways</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>So far, you have only seen glucose as a source of energy a cell can use, but you already
                                know that fats and other lipids contain a lot of energy that gets used up when glucose
                                is unavailable. </li>
                            <li>The aerobic breakdown (catabolism) of fats is accomplished by a process called
                                <strong>&#x3B2;-oxidation.</strong></li>
                            <li>Proteins can also provide a source of energy through a process called
                                <strong>deamination</strong><strong>.</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>&#x3B2;-oxidation of fats</h3>
                        <p>Enzymes in the matrix add CoA to the terminal ends of fatty-acid tails, allowing for the
                            stripping of electrons from the numerous C-H bonds by NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH. The end
                            result is the production of acetyl-CoA molecules. These enter the Krebs cycle and
                            respiration continues as usual with its regular production of NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> as
                            seen below.</p>
                        <h3>Deamination of proteins</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Proteins can be broken down into amino acids, which can then be deaminated to produce
                                energy-rich molecules that feed into cellular respiration pathways. </li>
                            <li>Amino acids all contain an amino group (-NH<sub>2</sub>), which is removed during the
                                process of deamination. Because of their unique functional groups, when different amino
                                acids are deaminated, they form products that can feed into glycolysis or the Krebs
                                cycle as seen below. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For example, alanine becomes pyruvate, and glutamate becomes &#x3B1;-ketoglutarate (one of
                            the compounds of the Krebs cycle). The process of deamination, however, results in the
                            production of the toxic substance, urea, which is filtered from the body by the kidneys and
                            excreted in urine.</p>

                        <p>Although it is the main carbon-rich source of energy for cellular respiration, glucose is not
                            the only source. Explain how other sources of carbon are oxidized for energy. Check the

                        <h3>Anaerobic cellular respiration</h3>
                        <p>Whether oxygen is present or not during glycolysis, the first set of electrons that are
                            oxidized from glucose reduce NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH. Cells do not have limitless supplies
                            of NAD<sup>+</sup> available to undergo reduction reactions to gain the electrons. Until the
                            NADH can offload their electrons to an acceptor like oxygen, they become unavailable for
                            further electron removal.</p>
                        <p>In anaerobic conditions where oxygen is not present, another electron acceptor must be used.
                            In the absence of oxygen, animal muscle cells and yeast cells have evolved different
                            mechanisms to handle this problem.</p>
                        <h3>Lactic acid fermentation in muscle cells</h3>
                        <p>Humans undertaking strenuous exercise use up oxygen faster than they can metabolize glucose,
                            so they will temporarily shift to producing <strong>lactic acid</strong> (lactate), which is
                            toxic and is the cause of muscle cramps. In the absence of oxygen, the protons and electrons
                            that were removed from glucose during glycolysis attach back onto pyruvate, creating lactic
                            acid. Increasing oxygen delivery reduces the uncomfortable symptoms produced by this process
                            and restarts aerobic cellular respiration.</p>

                        <h3>Alcohol fermentation in yeast cells</h3>
                        <p>In the case of alcoholic fermentation in yeast cells:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pyruvate is decarboxylated (CO<sub>2</sub> is removed), resulting in the formation of
                                the intermediate compound, acetaldehyde.</li>
                            <li>Acetaldehyde is then reduced as NADH dumps its electrons onto it to form ethanol
                                (alcohol). </li>
                            <li>Yeast used in the brewing of beer and winemaking undergoes this process until the
                                alcohol reaches a toxicity concentration of about 12%, killing all the cells.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Energy efficiency of respiration</h3>
                        <p>While anaerobic respiration can be accomplished by every type of cell, it still can only
                            provide the meager glycolytic payoff of two ATP per glucose molecule, which is much less
                            than the 32 ATP produced by aerobic respiration as a whole. </p>
                        <p>Even with this great payoff, aerobic respiration is still governed by the very real problem
                            posed by the second law of thermodynamics, which states that disorder is always increasing.
                            This reminds you that with every one of the 30 or so reactions that make up the oxidation of
                            glucose, energy is being incrementally stored; however, even more is being lost. </p>
                        <p>Just how much energy is being lost? </p>
                        <p>Calculate the energy lost to heat (disorder) using the following information and check your
                            answer with the provided answer. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The amount of energy stored in glucose (3012 kJ/glucose)</li>
                            <li>The amount of energy harvested as ATP per Glucose is 30 kJ/ATP</li>
                            <li>32 net ATP from the aerobic respiration of glucose</li>
                        </ul>

                            better than anaerobic cellular respiration, which only produces two ATP, translating to 2%
                            efficiency. </p>
                        <p>In aerobic respiration, some of the H<sup>+</sup> leaks out of the proton reservoir and makes
                            its way back into the matrix, thus avoiding ATP synthase, and some of the energy from the
                            proton pumps is actually used to power processes other than just ATP production. Therefore,
                            the real amount of net ATP actually available is more like 30 ATP, reducing the real
                            efficiency of the process to 30%. Losing this much energy isn&#x2019;t unusual in the
                            context of energy transfers, all of which have to follow the second law of thermodynamics.
                            The most efficient internal combustion engines are only able to transfer about 25% of
                            gasoline energy into the desired kinetic energy to turn the tires of a car.</p>

                    <p>Starting with a molecule of glucose, use graphic organizers to show how it is metabolized into
                        carbon dioxide molecules through aerobic cellular respiration. Also, show the other products of
                        cellular respiration (e.g. NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>).</p>
                    <h2>Part 2: Connect your learning</h2>
                    <p>Recall that you had been asked if you know of any fermented food products at the start of the
                        learning activity. You may now understand why organisms undergo this alternate pathway to
                        metabolize glucose. Fermented products are not just new trendy products in grocery stores.
                        Archaeological evidence from the Zagros Mountains of Iran suggests that fermentation has existed
                        as a food-processing method since around 5,000 BCE. Today, every region of the Earth seems to
                        have a cultural delicacy that uses biological organisms to ferment food or drink, in order to
                        create a new flavour. Kimchee, sauerkraut, pickles, injera, sago, yoghurt, and sour cream are
                        just a few examples of how varied fermented foods from around the world can be.</p>

                        class="img-responsive img-right-50">
                    <p>When most people think of fermentation, they think of brewing beer and winemaking. Many cultures
                        around the world discovered how to create fermented beverages early on in their history. Some
                        theorists suggest that the aristocracy of European nations stayed healthier than their peasantry
                        by drinking fermented beverages, rather than the contaminated water available to their
                        supporting classes. Currently, alcoholic beverages support a multi-billion-dollar industry,
                        internationally. Beer and wine producers often hire microbiologists, organic chemists, and
                        engineers, all of whom require a B.Sc.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_03.02.32.jpg" alt="A wine brewery" class="img-responsive img-left-50">
                    <p>Often, a graduate degree or an additional two years of study in brewing or winemaking from a
                        specialist institution may be required, if one plans to become a master brewer,
                        <strong>vintner</strong> (someone who makes or sells wine), <strong>oenologist</strong> (someone
                        who studies wines), or <strong>sommelier</strong> (wine steward). With so many successful
                        microbreweries in Canada, there is likely to always be some market for these skills. The
                        transferability of the training is high, considering the large number of foods that rely on
                        fermentation by living organisms, as part of their production.</p>

                    <p>Fermentation is used in more industrial applications than just food manufacturing. The use of
                        maize (corn), which is fermented to make ethanol fuel, has supported a growing agricultural and
                        industrial sector in North America in the last few decades, as increasingly more fuels contain
                        an ethanol component. Ethanol is mixed with gasoline to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and
                        to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which have been implicated as a contributing factor in
                        global climate change. </p>

                    <p>Looking at your notes for this learning activity. Are they complete? Do you have all the
                        information you will need to study later on? </p>
                    <p>Take the time to review concepts you are unsure about before moving on.</p>
