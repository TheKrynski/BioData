                <h2>Final Project Preparation: Part B</h2>
                <p>Throughout this course, you will have the opportunity to build knowledge and skills related to the
                    final project, and submit work for feedback, but not a grade, to help you prepare for the final
                    project. At this point, you will complete the second part of the preparation for your final project.
                    You will submit this for feedback.</p>
                <p>To prepare you for the the final project, you will be required to perform research on the topic of
                    modifying photosynthesis processes to help with crop growth. In your research, your goal is to find
                    one primary source (scholarly journal) that addresses modifying photosynthetic processes, and one
                    secondary source (non-scholarly) that addresses in some way the research from the scholarly journal,
                    to help put the research in context. Follow the instructions below to complete this, and then submit
                    your work for feedback.</p>
                <p>If you like, you may choose to use the following for your primary and secondary sources, but you are
                    welcome to perform your own research and find your own primary and secondary sources. </p>

                <h3>Journal review</h3>
                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Review the journal (scholarly article) first, and create a vocabulary list
                    (or
                    glossary of terms) that are new to you, or that have been learned in this course. You can research
                    the words to find the meaning, but the definition should be in your own words, and simplified so
                    that
                    it makes sense to you. Include 15 words. </p>
                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Read the journal article again slowly, and complete table 1 below. There may
                    be parts you cannot understand, and that is ok. Reading scientific journals is difficult for those
                    in university, too. This is why you are practicing this skill now. You will need to work through it
                    slowly.</p>
