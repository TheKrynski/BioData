                        <p>Concept mapping is a powerful learning tool to consolidate your understanding of a complex
                            concept. By linking key terms to each other in a radiating or hierarchical manner, you will
                            be visualizing the concept as a whole. </p>

                <b>Instructions:</b>
                <p>You will decide if you will complete the concept maps using a digital medium or by drawing it by
                    hand. The concept map will be quite large and complex.</p>
                <p>The main topic or concept will be “<strong>CELLULAR RESPIRATION</strong> and
                    <strong>PHOTOSYNTHESIS</strong>”. From this main concept, you will branch out and link to the other
                    concepts.</p>
                <p>Link the concepts with connectors and labels if there are concepts that are linked between units.
                    Note: the connecting arrows do not have to be linear, they may be curved.</p>

                <p><strong>Tips for constructing a Concept Map:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Start with a major theme or concept. This is usually at the top of the page or in the middle of
                        the page, but it does not have to be.</li>
                    <li>Shift from more complex to less complex ideas, or major to minor. These ideas or concepts should
                        be contained in boxes or ovals and should only be one or two words.</li>
                    <li>Connecting lines are drawn between concepts to recognize their relationships. Linking words are
                        placed on the lines stating the relationship between concepts. Linking words: contains, is a
                        part of, involves, uses, etc.</li>
                    <li>Cross links can be made between one part of the concept hierarchy or classification and another.
                    </li>
                    <li>Optional: Colour can be used to follow relationships, or as a visual aid.</li>
                </ul>
