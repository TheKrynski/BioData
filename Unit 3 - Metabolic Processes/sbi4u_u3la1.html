                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p> “You are what you eat” is a familiar saying that reminds us of the importance we should place on
                        our dietary choices. Behind this saying is the realization that the material we are made of, the
                        energy we use, and the chemical compounds that make our metabolism work all come from the things
                        we eat and drink.</p>
                    <p>This first learning activity in this unit, Metabolic Processes, introduces you to the role that
                        energy plays in metabolism. </p>

                    <h2>Energy for life</h2>
                    <p>In living things, a complex system of chemicals goes through a constant sequence of reactions,
                        and all of these reactions either require or release energy. <strong>Energy is the ability to do
                            work</strong>, and all living things devote a large part of their existence to collecting,
                        processing, storing, and using energy. While it is obvious that activities like walking,
                        running, and swimming require energy, it is easy to overlook the fact that processes such as
                        thinking or digesting also require energy.</p>

                    <p>The sum of all chemical reactions occurring in a living cell or organism is termed its metabolism
                        (derived from the Greek word, metabole, which means “change”). </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The metabolic reactions that build larger molecules from smaller molecules or atoms are
                            called <strong>anabolic</strong> reactions. </li>
                        <li>Those reactions that break large molecules down into smaller molecules or atoms are called
                            <strong>catabolic</strong> reactions.
                        </li>
                        <li>Two of the most important metabolic processes that are fundamental to all life are
                            <strong>cellular respiration</strong> and <strong>photosynthesis</strong>, which you will
                            study in detail in the next couple of lessons. These processes take place in specialized
                            structures within cells called <strong>chloroplasts</strong> and
                            <strong>mitochondria</strong>.

                    <p>amino acid + amino acid → dipeptide + water</p>
                    <p>Since two small monomers are combined to make a larger polymer, this reaction is considered
                        <strong>anabolic.</strong>

                        metabolic rate (RMR), represent the amount of energy used by a person at rest over a 24-hour
                        period. This is the amount of energy required to run the basic energetic needs of organs like
                        the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys.</p>

                        have an easier time keeping excess weight off. People who don’t exercise burn less energy all
                        the time and may still gain weight, even if they eat less than the active person. Simply by
                        being more active, you increase the amount of energy you expend, even while you are just resting

                                    <p>Two of the most common cardiovascular problems in Canada are heart attacks and
                                        strokes.</p>
                                    <h4>Heart attack</h4>
                                    <p>The heart, like any other muscle, gets the energy it needs from blood vessels
                                        carrying oxygen, sugars, and other nutrients. </p>
                                    <p>Heart disease has many causes, all of which affect the heart’s structure and
                                        functions.</p>
                                    <p>For example, coronary artery disease occurs when fatty materials, calcium, and
                                        scar tissue combine into a sticky substance called plaque, which is carried in
                                        the blood. The plaque can accumulate on the walls of coronary arteries and
                                        narrow their diameter. </p>

                                            <p>Sometimes, if enough plaque builds up, large clumps of it can become
                                                dislodged and completely block the blood flow through the artery that
                                                supplies blood to the heart’s muscle tissue. This can lead to a heart
                                                attack.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Stroke is caused by interruption of blood flow in the brain.
                                        </strong>Blood vessels leading to the brain can become blocked by plaque, or can
                                        rupture due to high blood pressure. When either happens, regions of the brain
                                        lose their blood supply and the neurons can fail to function properly, or may
                                        die. This results in temporary or permanent paralysis, or even death. </p>

                                                incidence is declining as more Canadians become aware of the importance

                    <h3>Caloric intake and dietary choices</h3>
                    <p>How much is too much? If you are at a healthy weight for your age, height, and biological sex
                        (male/female), then your goal should be to maintain your weight.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you want to find out your ideal weight, you may want to check with your physician. To
                            <strong>maintain your ideal weight,</strong> the amount of energy you take in should match
                            the amount of energy you expend. In this way, there would be no surplus energy to convert
                            into fat.
                        </li>
                        <li>If your goal, however, <strong>is to lose weight,</strong> then the amount of energy you
                            expend should exceed the amount of energy you take in. Therefore, it is important to know
                            how much energy content there is in the food that you eat.</li>
                        <li><strong>Many factors influence diet</strong>, including: cultural background, family, body
                            image, societal norms, economic status, health, medications, nutritional supplements,
                            frequency and intensity of exercise, age, sex, and genetics. </li>
                        <li>Think about your own situation. What factors determine what you eat? Are you influenced by
                            your friends and family or cultural background? Are there certain foods or dietary habits
                            that are central to your family gatherings? What role does the media play in determining
                            what you eat or how much? If you think about it, you might be surprised by how many of your
                            food decisions are based on the expectations of others.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Balanced diets and the Canada Food Guide</h3>
                    <p>A healthy diet needs to maintain a balance among the main types of foods. In Unit 2, you learned
                        about the important biomolecules or nutrients that are found in the foods you eat. You learned
                        that lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates provide energy and serve as building blocks for other
                        molecules.</p>
                    <p>The Canada Food Guide provides guidelines on the types of food to incorporate into your diet each
                        day, in order to provide a suggested amount of the variety of nutrients needed. In January 2019,
                        the Government of Canada released a new food guide that no longer provides a suggested serving
                        size or the amount of servings per day.</p>

                    <h4>Dietitian</h4>
                    <p>Dietitians, as experts in food and nutrition, counsel individuals, families, and communities and
                        work as integral parts of family health-care networks. They often work in health-care
                        institutions, such as retirement homes and hospitals, or may work for food production companies
                        or as university professors, researching improvements in diet.</p>
                    <p>Dietitians help to create balanced menus and educate people about healthy eating and lifestyles.
                    </p>
                    <p>In Ontario, the College of Dietitians of Ontario is the professional organization responsible for
                        regulating the profession. Becoming a registered dietitian in Ontario requires a four-year
                        undergraduate degree from an accredited university. Such a degree would include courses in
                        science (for example, chemistry and biology), nutrition, management, communication, and
                        psychology or sociology, among others. </p>

                    <h2>Energy for life processes</h2>
                    <p>You just learned how the choices you make daily play a role in your well-being. Your body needs a
                        certain amount of energy to carry out its basic functions and you obtain this energy by
                        ingesting food. Ingesting too much food with reduced physical activity is a detriment to your
                        health because the extra energy from food is turned into fat. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is
                        all about managing your diet and activity level. Essentially the ‘currency’ you must manage, in
                        terms of your health and well being, is energy using the metabolic processes in your body. </p>
                    <p>In the human body and ecosystems, the ‘currency’ of energy is captured and managed by one of the
                        most basic laws of science which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed but it can be
                        changed from one form to another. This is called the Law of the Conservation of Energy. </p>
                    <p>Examples of the Law of the Conservation of Energy are seen in ecosystems where energy is
                        transferred between biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) factors.</p>
                    <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
                    <p>All the metabolic energy in a functioning ecosystem comes from the process of
                        <strong>photosynthesis</strong> which occurs when a green plant is exposed to sunlight. Sunlight
                        is an abiotic factor. As a result, photosynthesis cycles nutrients and transforms solar energy
                        (energy from the sun) into chemical energy (energy stored in the bonds of glucose molecules).
                        The chemical energy stored in the bonds of glucose is used by organisms and converted to
                        metabolic energy during the process of <strong>cellular respiration.</strong> The organisms are
                        biotic factors.
                    </p>
                    <p>Thus, <strong>biotic factors</strong> and <strong>abiotic factors</strong> interact together in a
                        functioning ecosystem and these interactions <strong>cycle nutrients </strong>(matter) and
                        <strong>transfer energy.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>You will learn more details about the processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration in the
                        next two learning activities. </p>
                    <h3>Energy and the laws of thermodynamics </h3>
                    <p>Living things are defined in part by their capacity to collect and transfer energy to meet their
                        metabolic needs. Consequently, all living things must obey the physical laws of nature regarding
                        how energy is stored, used, and transferred.</p>
                    <h4>What is energy?</h4>
                    <p>Energy is defined as the ability to do work. It is available in a variety of forms, including
                        light, sound, mechanical energy, chemical energy, electrical energy, radiation and heat.</p>

                                always increasing. Each time energy is used, some will be converted (“lost”) to heat

                    <p>This means that disorder is always more likely to occur than order. What this means for life on

                    <h3>Energy in reactions</h3>
                    <p>The chemical energy stored in the bonds of chemicals, specifically reactants and products, is
                        changed during the course of a chemical reaction. Let’s take a closer look at these reactions
                        below.</p>
                    <h4>Endergonic reactions</h4>
                    <p>Reactions in which the reactants have <strong>less</strong> energy than their products require
                        energy and are thus termed endergonic reactions. </p>
                    <p>These non-spontaneous reactions require continual inputs of energy until the reaction is
                        completed.</p>

When the reaction starts, the reactants are at a low amount of energy. As the reaction progresses, the products have a higher amount of energy. Thus, there is an increase in energy stored."

                    <p>Endergonic reactions require additional inputs of energy to raise the atoms of their reactants
                        beyond the target energy level of their products, until they settle into a stable energy
                        plateau. The activation energy required is usually prohibitively high, necessitating the
                        presence of enzymes to catalyze the reaction.</p>
                    <h4>Exergonic reactions</h4>
                    <p>Reactions in which the reactants have more energy stored in their bonds than their products
                        release energy, and are termed exergonic reactions.</p>
                    <p>Once initiated, these spontaneous reactions do not require any energy inputs and will continue to
                        their completion. </p>

                    <p>Spontaneous reactions do not occur at random. For any reaction to occur, an initial amount of
                        activation energy must be supplied, in order to destabilize the reactants’ bonds so that they
                        may be broken and reformed. This energy of activation temporarily raises the energy level of the
                        reactants in the system, whether the reaction proceeds spontaneously or not. </p>
                    <p>Most reactions in living systems would not proceed at all if it were not for the catalytic role
                        provided by enzymes. As you learned in Unit 2, enzymes facilitate reactions, lowering the
                        required activation energy by straining the reactants’ bonds, making them unstable, so that less
                        energy is required to break them apart.</p>

                    <h4>How is energy transferred in redox reactions during the metabolism of living things? </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Electrons that are transferred from one atom or molecule to another atom or molecule carry
                            energy with them. This energy can be stored or released in molecules that are involved in a
                            metabolic process (such as photosynthesis or cellular respiration). </li>
                        <li>Reduced molecules or atoms receive an electron from oxidized molecules or atoms.
                            Consequently, reduced molecules or atoms are raised to higher energy levels and oxidized
                            molecules or atoms have lowered energy levels. </li>
                        <li>Reduced molecules or atoms are raised to higher energy levels because electrons repel each
                            other. Adding more electrons to an atom is like pressing down on a spring. Just as pushing
                            on a spring increases the potential energy of the spring, adding more electrons increases
                            the potential energy of the atom.</li>
                        <li><strong>Specialized molecules</strong>, called <strong>energy carriers or
                                coenzymes</strong>, become reduced and oxidized as electrons are shuttled from one
                            enzyme to the next through metabolic pathways, delivering or harvesting energy at each
                            stage.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Let’s look at a specific examples of redox reactions in living organisms which uses a molecule
                        called Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>),</p>
                    <h4>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>)</h4>

                                    dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), is a key player in the transfer of energy. </li>
                                <li>When oxidized, NAD<sup>+</sup> is electron-deficient. It is in a low-energy state,
                                    so it carries a positive overall ionic charge (as indicated by the positive symbol
                                    on the top right-hand side). </li>
                                <li>NAD<sup>+</sup> readily accepts H atoms and their associated high-energy electrons
                                    as they are stripped from the higher-energy molecules in the pathways that are
                                    donating them. When NAD<sup>+</sup> accepts a hydrogen proton and two electrons from
                                    the active site of an enzyme, it becomes its reduced, energy-rich form, NADH (see

                        enzyme&ndash;catalyzed reactions to occur. </p>
                    <p>Cells can only get their energy from glucose. Glucose is packed with a lot of energy and cells
                        need to save the unused energy by storing the energy they get from processing glucose into
                        smaller packets. These smaller energy packets can then be used to run a variety of different
                        processes, all while wasting as little energy as possible. These smaller energy packets are ATP.
                    </p>
                    <p>A mole of ATP stores and releases 54 kJ of energy which is less than 2% of the energy available
                        in the 3,012 kJ/mol of glucose.</p>
                    <p>ATP is sometimes described as the energy “currency of the cell.” </p>

                    <h4>A useful analogy for ATP</h4>
                    <p>Here is an analogy to help you understand the connection between glucose molecules and ATP. </p>
                    <p>You can think of glucose as a $100 bill and ATP as the $1 coins of change you get when you
                        “break” large bill, such as glucose. </p>
                    <p>Cells need to make “metabolic change” by storing the energy they get from processing glucose into
                        smaller packets, ATP or “loonies”, which can then be used to run a variety of different
                        processes, all while wasting as little energy as possible. </p>

                    <p>The stable adenosine subunit has three phosphate groups (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3–</sup>) attached to
                        it. The single-bonded oxygen atoms of the phosphate groups are highly negative and repulse each
                        other, making them unstable. This results in the formation of a high-energy (54 kJ/mol) bond
                        between the second and third phosphate.</p>
                    <p>Cells get energy from ATP by hydrolyzing the unstable high-energy bond, which creates the two
                        products, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi), and the release of 30 kJ/mol
                        of energy. This is an exergonic reaction </p>

                    <h4>The ATP cycle</h4>
                    <p>ATP is used to provide the energy to drive endergonic reactions involving enzymes, such as the
                        synthesis of polypeptides, DNA, and complex polysaccharides. The energy required to make ATP is
                        from the exergonic reactions of metabolizing (breaking down) carbohydrates, proteins or lipids.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/sbi4u_03.01.38.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">

                    <p>In such cases, the Pi (inorganic phosphate) can act as an allosteric activator. It attaches to
                        the allosteric site on the enzyme, which changes the shape of its active site, thus “turning it
                        on” to accept substrate(s). </p>
                    <p>By providing energy for the reaction, as well as by activating the enzyme, the hydrolysis of ATP
                        speeds up the reaction in two ways and so improves the cell’s energy efficiency.</p>
