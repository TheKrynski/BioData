                    <p>All living things get their energy from the sun, either directly or through the consumption of
                        organic carbon-containing compounds (mainly sugars) made by plants. Understanding which

                        complicated process.</p>

                    <p>The process by which light energy is captured and channeled into the production of food molecules
                        is called <b>photosynthesis</b>. During this process there are dozens of reactions, involving
                        many enzymes and coenzymes at every step. Reactions occur in different structures and under
                        varying conditions, but can be summarized in the following photosynthetic equation:</p>

                    <p>Plants, algae, and some bacteria all use light energy to form carbohydrates. Some bacteria are
                        chemosynthetic and do not need light energy at all; they get their energy from other molecules.
                        These ancient organisms likely evolved before oxygen-producing organisms existed.</p>
                    <p>In this course, you will concentrate on the process of photosynthesis in green oxygen-producing

                    <p>Chlorophyll comes in two main forms (called a and b) that differ only in one functional group:
                        methyl (-CH<sub>3</sub>) in chlorophyll a, and carbonyl (-CHO) in chlorophyll b. These two forms
                        of chlorophyll belong to a group of molecules called <b>pigments</b>. Pigments absorb light
                        energy at specific electromagnetic wavelengths, depending on the pigment’s colour. The following
                        image shows the electromagnetic spectrum. Plants’ pigments absorb light mostly within the
                        visible spectrum. Other pigments, called <b>accessory pigments</b>, include <b>carotenoids</b>
                        and <b>xanthophylls</b>. </p>

                        nm respectively), and generally do not absorb, but instead reflect, the green light wavelengths
                        from 500–600 nm. This is why green plants are green. Only chlorophyll a can absorb the energy
                        and transfer the electrons required for photosynthesis. However, chlorophyll b, and various
                        other accessory pigments, can absorb energy and pass electrons to chlorophyll a, thus allowing a
                        wider range of light energy to be harvested. Their collective absorptions add to form a combined
                        absorption spectrum that allows for the entire range of visible light wavelengths to be
                        captured. Their combined effect is called the <b>action spectrum</b>.</p>

                    <h2>Two stages of photosynthesis</h2>
                    <p>Photosynthetic reactions are traditionally divided into two stages. The first stage requires
                        light, so its reactions are called “light-dependent reactions,” or just “light reactions,” while
                        the second stage’s reactions do not require light and are therefore called “light-independent
                        reactions,” or “dark reactions.” It is important that you do not assume that the “dark
                        reactions” only occur in the absence of light, as they occur whether or not light is present.
                        Thus, this stage is now referred to as the Calvin Cycle. The Calvin Cycle, which is responsible
                        for combining carbon into sugar molecules, is powered by the energy harvested during the light
                        reactions. The process of combining the carbon atoms from carbon dioxide into a glucose molecule
                        is called “fixing” the
                        carbon.</p>
                    <p>Each stage can be broken down into three steps:</p>

Next, the electron proceeds to photosystem 700, where it receives an energy boost and is carried by ferrodoxin (Fd) to the enzyme NADP reductase where NADPH is formed.

                                    <p>Electrons are excited by energy absorbed from light photons, first in photosystem
                                        II and then in photosystem I. The photon energy is used to eject a high-energy
                                        electron from chlorophyll, which is then passed from one electron acceptor to
                                        another via redox reactions. This releases energy in a step-by-step manner, and
                                        finally ends up being incorporated into NADPH, upon its reduction. The electrons
                                        are replaced by free electrons that were generated by the splitting of water at
                                        the beginning of the process.</p>

                                        (H<sup>+</sup>). Electron transport creates an electrochemical potential of
                                        hydrogen protons across the photosynthetic membrane through two reactions:</p>

                                    <p>In this process, H<sup>+</sup> ions become so concentrated in the lumen that they
                                        are pushed out by their own numbers. Due to their charge, the H<sup>+</sup> ions
                                        cannot effectively diffuse across the membrane. Instead, they are channelled
                                        through a transmembrane enzyme complex called ATP synthase, which converts the
                                        proton motive force into the chemical energy of ATP. This enzyme catalyzes a
                                        phosphorylation reaction, forming ATP through the addition of inorganic
                                        phosphate (Pi) to ADP, as protons pass through it to the stroma. The energy

                                    <h5>Non-cyclic photophosphorylation </h5>

                                    <p>It is important to note that green plants predominantly use non-cyclic
                                        photophosphorylation. This means that the electrons that are donated by
                                        chlorophyll a are never returned to it. Instead, the electrons are accepted by
                                        NADP, at the end of the process, to form NADPH. The electrons being donated from
                                        chlorophyll a need to be replaced, however, which is accomplished by supplying
                                        electrons that are continuously being stripped from water.</p>
                                    <p>The path of the electrons is a linear sequence that looks like this:</p>
                                    <p>Water → photosystem II &rarr; ETC &rarr; photosystem I &rarr; ETC &rarr; NADPH
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The ETC for non-cyclic photophosphorylation shown. The pathway of the excited
                                        electron is shown as the dotted line. The hydrogen protons generated by the
                                        oxidation of water and the ETC build up inside the thylakoid lumen, where they
                                        help to create a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This gradient
                                        (proton motive force) is used by ATP synthase to generate ATP, whose energy is
                                        used later to help make glucose.</p>

                                    <h5>Cyclic photophosphorylation </h5>

                                    <p>In contrast, during <b>cyclic photophosphorylation</b>, which occurs in some
                                        photosynthetic bacteria, the electrons that are donated by chlorophyll a are
                                        returned to it via the ETC. Only ATP is generated from the H<sup>+</sup> proton
                                        gradient that is created. Since there is no free electron available to attach to
                                        NADP<sup>+</sup>, there is no NADPH produced. The path of the electrons is a
                                        loop that cycles between photosystem I and the ETC.</p>

                    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
                    <p>The second stage of photosynthesis, whose reactions are called the <b>light-independent reactions
                            (or the Calvin Cycle)</b>, uses the ATP and H<sup>+</sup> protons from the light-dependent
                        reactions to reduce carbon from CO<sub>2</sub> to form carbohydrate molecules like glucose. The
                        light-independent reactions can occur in sunshine or in darkness, since they do not depend on
                        photons for energy.</p>
                    <p>Carbon reduction involves a series of enzyme-mediated reactions in the stroma of the chloroplast.
                        To eventually build complex organic molecules containing many carbon atoms, such as sugar,
                        plants must start by attaching single carbon atoms to smaller carbon-containing molecules. All
                        plants and algae obtain the single carbon atoms from CO<sub>2</sub>, available from the
                        environment, and eventually use these atoms to produce glucose through the Calvin cycle. To form
                        one molecule of glucose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), six carbon atoms must be
                        combined. Since one carbon atom is combined per loop of the cycle, the Calvin cycle must run six
                        times for every glucose molecule produced hence the equation for photosynthesis:</p>

                                        present in the stroma. The enzyme, RuBP carboxylase (commonly called rubisco),
                                        catalyzes the exergonic reaction between RuBP and CO<sub>2</sub>. This phase is
                                        called carbon fixation because carbon atoms from carbon dioxide are being
                                        incorporated into organic molecules. Biochemists call this incorporation
                                        “fixing” the carbon atoms.</p>
                                    <p>The combination of RuBP and CO<sub>2</sub> creates an unstable intermediate
                                        compound, which immediately splits, yielding two molecules of the 3-carbon
                                        compound, PGA (3-phosphoglycerate). Three CO<sub>2</sub> (1C x 3 = 3C) and three
                                        RuBP (5C x 3 = 15C) undergo this stage of the Calvin cycle to produce six PGA
                                        (18C) required to eventually make one molecule of the 3-carbon product of this
                                        stage, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, or G3P). Since one entire turn of the cycle
                                        represents the reactions involved for each CO<sub>2</sub> that enters it, the
                                        cycle must be repeated three times to produce one molecule of G3P (3C). Since it
                                        takes two G3P molecules to make one glucose molecule (6C), the cycle must run
                                        six times per glucose molecule.</p>

                                    <p>In the second phase, each of the six PGA molecules created from carbon fixation
                                        is raised to a higher energy level by the addition of a phosphate group. The
                                        phosphate comes from the ATP generated during the light-dependent reactions.</p>
                                    <p>The resulting molecule is called 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (PGAP). This molecule is
                                        quickly converted to G3P in a reduction reaction, using the NADPH that was also
                                        generated during the light-dependent reactions. Thus, six ATP and six NADPH are
                                        used to produce one G3P molecule that goes on to become glucose.</p>

                                    <p>One of the six G3P leaves the cycle, while the other five remain behind to
                                        replenish the supply of RuBP to keep the cycle going. The G3P molecule that
                                        leaves the cycle is used to produce a variety of carbohydrate compounds such as
                                        glucose and fructose which can then be synthesized into sucrose or starch.</p>

                    <p>C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants adapt to temperatures that are less than optimal for
                        photosynthesis by using different methods to manage or prevent photorespiration.
                        Photorespiration is a process that reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis, thus preventing
                        photosynthesis when unfavourable temperatures are present. Rubisco, the enzyme that catalyzes
                        the first step in the Calvin cycle, is required to fix carbon dioxide. However, Rubisco can also
                        react with oxygen instead of carbon dioxide. If this occurs, it would lead to a less efficient
                        photosynthetic rate. Photorespiration results when plants try to conserve water loss when the
                        temperature rises above the optimal temperature for photosynthesis as seen in the image below.
                    </p>
                    <p>As it turns out, C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants differ in their rate of photorespiration.
                        The higher the plant’s rate of photorespiration, the less efficient it is at converting sunlight
                        into food. C<sub>4</sub> plants have important adaptations that make them more efficient at
                        higher temperatures than C<sub>3</sub> plants, but less efficient at lower temperatures.</p>

                                        barley, potatoes, cotton, and sugar beets from other plants. </p>
                                    <p>These C<sub>3</sub> plants use the enzyme rubisco (also known as RuBP
                                        carboxylase) to join CO<sub>2</sub> taken from the air and fix it to a 5-carbon
                                        molecule (RuBP) to create two copies of the 3-carbon molecule, G3P.</p>

                                    <p>The C<sub>3</sub> plants make up 95% of the earth’s plant biomass. However,
                                        C<sub>3</sub> plants cannot grow well in hot, dry areas because these conditions
                                        produce higher rates of photorespiration for them, which limit their growth.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>For example, at a growing temperature of 25<sup>o</sup>C, 20% of the photosynthetically
                                        fixed carbon is lost by C<sub>3</sub> plants to photorespiration. At temperatures higher than 28&#x2103;, increased rates of photorespiration can cause the loss of 25–50% of their photosynthetically fixed carbon.</p>

                                    <p>These plants limit photorespiration by carrying out the C<sub>4</sub> pathway at
                                        night and switching to the Calvin cycle during the day.</p>

                                    <p>CAM plants differ from C<sub>4</sub> plants because they combine the
                                        C<sub>4</sub> pathway and Calvin cycle within the same cell, but carry them out
                                        at different times. </p>
                                    <p>This <b>temporal separation</b> is accomplished in part by reversing the timing
                                        of stomatal openings that you would normally see in most other plants. </p>
                                    <p>The stomata (singular, stoma) are specialized pores on the surface of leaves that
                                        allow CO<sub>2</sub> in and H<sub>2</sub>O out, and which can be opened or closed by the
                                        plant. Most plants keep their stomata open during the day to absorb
                                        CO<sub>2</sub> when photosynthesis is active, and closed at night to prevent
                                        water loss. </p>
                                    <p>At night they fix CO<sub>2</sub>, using the same C<sub>4</sub> pathway as
                                        C<sub>4</sub> plants, to accumulate carbon compounds. These compounds are then
                                        decarboxylated during the day.</p>
                                    <p>This causes a high concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> during the day, which
                                        activates the C<sub>3</sub> pathway and suppresses photorespiration.</p>

                                    <p>Thus, by modifying leaf structure, photosynthetic processes, and the timing of
                                        these processes, C<sub>4</sub> and CAM plants can work around the problem of
                                        photorespirative loss of carbon (as CO<sub>2</sub>) that is found in
                                        C<sub>3</sub> plants.</p>

                                    <p>C<sub>4</sub> plants do this by <b>spatially isolating</b> high concentrations of
                                        CO<sub>2</sub> in two different cells, while CAM plants temporally isolate
                                        CO<sub>2</sub> (day versus night) within the same cell.</p>
